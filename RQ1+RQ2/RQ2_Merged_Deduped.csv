Structural Entropy-based Multivariate Time Series Forecasting,"Multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting is crucial for predicting the future states of complexly coupled variables based on historical observations. To effectively capture the intricate interdependencies within MTS, graph-based methods have emerged as powerful tools. However, existing graph construction methods often produce structures that fail to preserve key temporal and cross-variable dependencies, introducing redundant or irrelevant connections. To address these challenges, we propose a structural entropy-based approach for MTS forecasting. The approach optimizes graph structures by reducing structural redundancy, thereby improving forecasting accuracy. Initially, we represent the temporal dependences by constructing an encoding tree incrementally. Through hierarchical organization of time steps, the temporal evolution is adaptively captured. Subsequently, we give the community-aware representation by building an encoding tree over the variables in MTS, extracting homogeneous communities from the tree structure while integrating community influence to better capture inter-variable dependencies. Finally,we present a training algorithm designed to generate accurate predictions for MTS, accompanied by a unified loss function that integrates forecasting inaccuracies with variations in structural entropy. Empirical findings on real-world datasets substantiate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models in capturing dependencies and enhancing forecasting precision.",10.1145/3746252.3761007,2025,,ACM
CrossLinear: Plug-and-Play Cross-Correlation Embedding for Time Series Forecasting with Exogenous Variables,"Time series forecasting with exogenous variables is a critical emerging paradigm that presents unique challenges in modeling dependencies between variables. Traditional models often struggle to differentiate between endogenous and exogenous variables, leading to inefficiencies and overfitting. In this paper, we introduce CrossLinear, a novel Linear-based forecasting model that addresses these challenges by incorporating a plug-and-play cross-correlation embedding module. This lightweight module captures the dependencies between variables with minimal computational cost and seamlessly integrates into existing neural networks. Specifically, it captures time-invariant and direct variable dependencies while disregarding time-varying or indirect dependencies, thereby mitigating the risk of overfitting in dependency modeling and contributing to consistent performance improvements. Furthermore, CrossLinear employs patch-wise processing and a global linear head to effectively capture both short-term and long-term temporal dependencies, further improving its forecasting precision. Extensive experiments on 12 real-world datasets demonstrate that CrossLinear achieves superior performance in both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks. The ablation study underscores the effectiveness of the cross-correlation embedding module. Additionally, the generalizability of this module makes it a valuable plug-in for various forecasting tasks across different domains.

Deep Coupling Network for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting,"Multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting is crucial in many real-world applications. To achieve accurate MTS forecasting, it is essential to simultaneously consider both intra- and inter-series relationships among time series data. However, previous work has typically modeled intra- and inter-series relationships separately and has disregarded multi-order interactions present within and between time series data, which can seriously degrade forecasting accuracy. In this article, we reexamine intra- and inter-series relationships from the perspective of mutual information and accordingly construct a comprehensive relationship learning mechanism tailored to simultaneously capture the intricate multi-order intra- and inter-series couplings. Based on the mechanism, we propose a novel deep coupling network for MTS forecasting, named DeepCN, which consists of a coupling mechanism dedicated to explicitly exploring the multi-order intra- and inter-series relationships among time series data concurrently, a coupled variable representation module aimed at encoding diverse variable patterns, and an inference module facilitating predictions through one forward step. Extensive experiments conducted on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed DeepCN achieves superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.",10.1145/3653447,2024,,ACM
Graph Deep Factors for Probabilistic Time-series Forecasting,"Effective time-series forecasting methods are of significant importance to solve a broad spectrum of research problems. Deep probabilistic forecasting techniques have recently been proposed for modeling large collections of time-series. However, these techniques explicitly assume either complete independence (local model) or complete dependence (global model) between time-series in the collection. This corresponds to the two extreme cases where every time-series is disconnected from every other time-series in the collection or likewise, that every time-series is related to every other time-series resulting in a completely connected graph. In this work, we propose a deep hybrid probabilistic graph-based forecasting framework called Graph Deep Factors (GraphDF) that goes beyond these two extremes by allowing nodes and their time-series to be connected to others in an arbitrary fashion. GraphDF is a hybrid forecasting framework that consists of a relational global and relational local model. In particular, a relational global model learns complex non-linear time-series patterns globally using the structure of the graph to improve both forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency. Similarly, instead of modeling every time-series independently, a relational local model not only considers its individual time-series but also the time-series of nodes that are connected in the graph. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed deep hybrid graph-based forecasting model compared to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of its forecasting accuracy, runtime, and scalability. Our case study reveals that GraphDF can successfully generate cloud usage forecasts and opportunistically schedule workloads to increase cloud cluster utilization by 47.5\% on average. Furthermore, we target addressing the common nature of many time-series forecasting applications where time-series are provided in a streaming version; however, most methods fail to leverage the newly incoming time-series values and result in worse performance over time. In this article, we propose an online incremental learning framework for probabilistic forecasting. The framework is theoretically proven to have lower time and space complexity. The framework can be universally applied to many other machine learning-based methods.",10.1145/3543511,2023,,ACM
Telecommunications Product Revenue Time-Series Forecasting Using Target Variable Preprocessing Methods,"Accurate revenue forecasting is critical for decision-making support of telecommunications companies (telcos). This study explored the use of machine learning for time-series revenue forecasting of a telco product. While existing research explores machine learning for time-series forecasting primarily for stocks price prediction and different use cases in other industries, this study focused on telco revenue and the impact of target variable preprocessing on forecasting accuracy. Two datasets with different business rules for the same attribute were used, with two preprocessing techniques for converting monthly revenue data to daily applied to each dataset: even distribution and a weighted distribution based on daily subscriber count. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), specifically long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU), were employed for revenue prediction. Various factors were used to produce additional model variations, specifically seed selection, dataset, preprocessing technique, and input window size. Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) was the key metric for comparison of model performance. The results showed that weighted preprocessing produced the most accurate model with an MAPE of 3.08\% despite its reliance on a specific variable combination. This study concludes that target variable preprocessing impacts model outputs, with weighted distribution offering the highest accuracy for telco product revenue forecasting using RNNs.",10.1145/3690771.3690784,2025,,ACM
Multiple Time Series Forecasting with Dynamic Graph Modeling,"Multiple time series forecasting plays an essential role in many applications. Solutions based on graph neural network (GNN) that deliver state-of-the-art forecasting performance use the relation graph which can capture historical correlations among time series. However, in real world, it is common that correlations among time series evolve across time, resulting in dynamic relation graph, where the future correlations may be different from those in history. To address this problem, we propose multiple time series forecasting with dynamic graph modeling (MTSF-DG) that is able to learn historical relation graphs and predicting future relation graphs to capture the dynamic correlations. We also propose a causal GNN to extract features from both kinds of relation graphs efficiently. Then we propose a reasoning network to explicitly learn the variant influence from historical timestamps to future timestamps for final forecasting. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets show that MTSF-DG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, and justify our design with dynamic relation graph modeling.",10.14778/3636218.3636230,2023,,ACM
Weakly Guided Adaptation for Robust Time Series Forecasting,"Robust multivariate time series forecasting is crucial in many cyberphysical and Internet of Things applications. Existing state-of-the-art robust forecasting models decompose time series into independent functions covering trends and periodicities. However, these independent functions fail to capture correlations among multiple time series, thereby reducing prediction accuracy. Moreover, existing robust forecasting models treat certain abrupt but normal changes, e.g., caused by holidays, as outliers because they occur infrequently and have data distributions that resemble those of outliers. This exacerbates model bias and reduces prediction accuracy. This paper aims to capture correlations across multiple time series and abrupt but normal changes, thereby improving prediction accuracy. We employ weak labels to partition the dataset into source and target domains. Then, we propose the Domain Adversarial Robust Forecaster (DARF). This forecasting model is based on adversarial domain adaptation and includes two novel modules: Correlated Robust Forecaster (CORF) and Domain Critic. Specifically, CORF constitutes an encoder-decoder framework proficient at robust multivariate time series forecasting, and Domain Critic works to reduce data bias. Extensive experiments and discussions show that DARF is capable of state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy.",10.14778/3636218.3636231,2023,,ACM
A Distribution Graph Guided Network with Dual Track Self-Supervised Strategy for Tobacco Pest Time Series Forecasting,"Tobacco pest is one of the main factors that harm tobacco quality in tobacco factories, leading to economic losses. Accurate prediction of pest distribution is crucial for the management and production of tobacco factories. Nevertheless, conventional time series forecasting techniques prove inadequate in capturing sufficient information for fine-grained forecasting tasks involving district-variable-level and day-sampling-level tobacco pest datasets. This limitation arises from the lack of consideration for the knowledge pertaining to the migration and reproduction patterns of tobacco pests. In this work, a dual track self-supervised and distribution graph guided network (DTSSDGN) is proposed to handle this problem. First, a distribution graph guided feature extraction module is designed to help capture the internal and external patterns of pest distribution. Subsequently, a two-stage training strategy is devised, comprising a dual-track self-supervised training phase to acquire features that possess a comprehensive understanding of the pest distribution trend, followed by a fine-grained fine-tuning phase that leverages this knowledge to achieve accurate forecasting outcomes. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are illustrated on a real tobacco pest distribution dataset.",10.1145/3704558.3707079,2025,,ACM
AGGA-MVFLN: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting via Adaptive Generalized Graph Accompanied with Multi-View Learning in Frequency Domain,"A growing body of recent researches have migrated graph structure learning (GSL) to the multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), which lays the foundation for the promotion of ''Generalized Graph'' for multimedia MTSF applications. In other words, we expect generalized graph to encompass the learning of inter-variable, inter-temporal and latent correlations, becoming a universal tool for multivariate correlations learning. However, due to the heterogeneity of multivariate time series in distribution, graph learning inevitably captures inaccurate relationships, which requires the quality of graph learning; Meanwhile MTSF often requires instant predictions for decision-making in real-world, which also challenges the speed of GSL. To solve these challenges, we propose AGGA-MVFLN, namely Adaptive Generalized Graph Accompanied Multi-View Frequency Learning Network. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive generalized graph structure from multi-view (global and local) to capture diverse ''spatio-temporal patterns''. Subsequently, we utilize the Fast Fourier Transform to map them into the frequency domain, and enhance the quality of the generalized graph by collaboratively learning the complementarities and differences through reconstructed ''spatio-temporal patterns'' and error-driven supervised training of adaptive graph. The benefits are: (1) The frequency domain can disentangle complex temporal patterns, making the process of learning multivariate relationships more robust. (2) Multi-view learning can significantly reduce training time by preset and seamless integration (i.e., the multi-task loss form). (3) ''Generalized Graph'' can be regarded as universal component for multivariate correlation learning. Evaluation of 9 real-world datasets confirms the superiority of AGGA-MVFLN over SOTA benchmark.",10.1145/3731715.3733272,2025,,ACM
Credit Card Transaction Trend Forecasting Based on Graph Neural Network,"Accurate prediction of customer transaction trend can provide effective technical support for banks in managing their credit card business. Customer transaction behaviors often involve multiple types of consumption, and existing forecasting methods typically concatenate multi-type features into a unified input, which inadequately accounts for structural differences and interactions among different transaction types. To address this issue, this paper proposes TTF-GNN, a credit card transaction trend forecasting model based on graph neural networks. The proposed method effectively explores customer behavioral characteristics in multi-type transaction scenarios by integrating type-aware embedding with time-varying sensitive graph construction. It jointly captures temporal dynamics and interdependencies among multiple transaction types through spatio-temporal graph convolution, thereby enabling accurate prediction of future trends. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms several exiting forecasting models across multiple evaluation metrics, confirming its effectiveness and adaptability.",10.1145/3762249.3762299,2025,,ACM
A Survey on Recommender Systems Using Graph Neural Network,"The expansion of the Internet has resulted in a change in the flow of information. With the vast amount of digital information generated online, it is easy for users to feel overwhelmed. Finding the specific information can be a challenge, and it can be difficult to distinguish credible sources from unreliable ones. This has made recommender system (RS) an integral part of the information services framework. These systems alleviate users from information overload by analyzing users’ past preferences and directing only desirable information toward users. Traditional RSs use approaches like collaborative and content-based filtering to generate recommendations. Recently, these systems have evolved to a whole new level, intuitively optimizing recommendations using deep network models. graph neural networks (GNNs) have become one of the most widely used approaches in RSs, capturing complex relationships between users and items using graphs. In this survey, we provide a literature review of the latest research efforts done on GNN-based RSs. We present an overview of RS, discuss its generalized pipeline and evolution with changing learning approaches. Furthermore, we explore basic GNN architecture and its variants used in RSs, their applications, and some critical challenges for future research.",10.1145/3694784,2024,,ACM
RPMixer: Shaking Up Time Series Forecasting with Random Projections for Large Spatial-Temporal Data,"Spatial-temporal forecasting systems play a crucial role in addressing numerous real-world challenges. In this paper, we investigate the potential of addressing spatial-temporal forecasting problems using general time series forecasting models, i.e., models that do not leverage the spatial relationships among the nodes. We propose a all-Multi-Layer Perceptron (all-MLP) time series forecasting architecture called RPMixer. The all-MLP architecture was chosen due to its recent success in time series forecasting benchmarks. Furthermore, our method capitalizes on the ensemble-like behavior of deep neural networks, where each individual block within the network behaves like a base learner in an ensemble model, particularly when identity mapping residual connections are incorporated. By integrating random projection layers into our model, we increase the diversity among the blocks' outputs, thereby improving the overall performance of the network. Extensive experiments conducted on the largest spatial-temporal forecasting benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms 14 alternative methods.",10.1145/3637528.3671881,2024,,ACM
CAMul: Calibrated and Accurate Multi-view Time-Series Forecasting,"Probabilistic time-series forecasting enables reliable decision making across many domains. Most forecasting problems have diverse sources of data containing multiple modalities and structures. Leveraging information from these data sources for accurate and well-calibrated forecasts is an important but challenging problem. Most previous works on multi-view time-series forecasting aggregate features from each data view by simple summation or concatenation and do not explicitly model uncertainty for each data view. We propose a general probabilistic multi-view forecasting framework CAMul, which can learn representations and uncertainty from diverse data sources. It integrates the information and uncertainty from each data view in a dynamic context-specific manner, assigning more importance to useful views to model a well-calibrated forecast distribution. We use CAMul for multiple domains with varied sources and modalities and show that CAMul outperforms other state-of-art probabilistic forecasting models by over 25\% in accuracy and calibration.",10.1145/3485447.3512037,2022,,ACM
A Spatial-Temporal Aggregated Graph Neural Network for Docked Bike-sharing Demand Forecasting,"Predicting the number of rented and returned bikes at each station is crucial for operators to proactively manage shared bike relocation. Although existing research has proposed spatial-temporal prediction models that significantly advance traffic prediction, these models often neglect the unique characteristics of shared bike systems (BSS). Spatially, the entire bike-sharing system (BSS) experiences peak activity during morning and evening rush hours, whereas, during other periods, activity is localized to local stations, with some recording no rides, highlighting the need to distinguish between global and local spatial information across different times. Temporally, the historical riding records for each station exhibit non-stationary patterns, necessitating the analysis of both global trends and local fluctuations. Existing Graph Neural Network (GNN) approaches to predicting shared bike demand primarily capture static spatial-temporal data and fail to account for the dynamic nature of bike flows. Moreover, these studies focus on global spatial-temporal information without considering local nuances, making it challenging to capture spatiotemporal dynamics in fluctuating BSS. To address these challenges, we introduce the Spatial-Temporal Aggregated Graph Neural Network (STAGNN). Our model first constructs a dynamic adjacent matrix to describe the evolving connections between stations, followed by local and global information layers to capture spatial-temporal information from large-scale shared bike networks accurately. Our methodology has been validated through experiments on four real-world datasets, comparing it against benchmark models to demonstrate superior prediction accuracy. Additionally, we conduct extended experiments on four datasets during the morning and evening rush hours, and the results also affirm the efficacy of the STAGNN in enhancing prediction performance.",10.1145/3690388,2024,,ACM
Modeling Temporal Patterns with Dilated Convolutions for Time-Series Forecasting,"Time-series forecasting is an important problem across a wide range of domains. Designing accurate and prompt forecasting algorithms is a non-trivial task, as temporal data that arise in real applications often involve both non-linear dynamics and linear dependencies, and always have some mixtures of sequential and periodic patterns, such as daily, weekly repetitions, and so on. At this point, however, most recent deep models often use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to capture these temporal patterns, which is hard to parallelize and not fast enough for real-world applications especially when a huge amount of user requests are coming. Recently, CNNs have demonstrated significant advantages for sequence modeling tasks over the de-facto RNNs, while providing high computational efficiency due to the inherent parallelism. In this work, we propose HyDCNN, a novel hybrid framework based on fully Dilated CNN for time-series forecasting tasks. The core component in HyDCNN is a proposed hybrid module, in which our proposed position-aware dilated CNNs are utilized to capture the sequential non-linear dynamics and an autoregressive model is leveraged to capture the sequential linear dependencies. To further capture the periodic temporal patterns, a novel hop scheme is introduced in the hybrid module. HyDCNN is then composed of multiple hybrid modules to capture the sequential and periodic patterns. Each of these hybrid modules targets on either the sequential pattern or one kind of periodic patterns. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets have shown that the proposed HyDCNN is better compared with state-of-the-art baselines and is at least 200\% better than RNN baselines. The datasets and source code will be published in Github to facilitate more future work.",10.1145/3453724,2021,,ACM
Dyn-GWN: Time-Series Forecasting using Time-varying Graphs with Applications to Finance and Traffic Prediction,"Spatio-temporal modeling is an essential lens to understand many real-world phenomena from traffic to finance. There has been exciting work that explores spatio-temporal modeling with temporal graph convolutional networks. Often these methods assume that the spatial structure is static. We propose a new model Dyn-GWN&nbsp;for spatio-temporal learning from time-varying graphs. Our model relies on a novel module called the Tensor Graph Convolutional Module&nbsp;(TGCM), which captures dynamic trends in graphs effectively in the time-varying graph representations. This module has two components: (i) it applies temporal dilated convolutions both on the time-varying graph adjacency space and the time-varying features. (ii) it aggregates the higher-level latent representations from both time-varying components through a proposed layer TGCL. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of these model across time-series data from finance and traffic domains. Dyn-GWN&nbsp; can give up to better out-of-sample performance than prior methods that learn from time-varying graphs, e.g., EvolveGCN and TM-GCN. Interestingly, Dyn-GWN&nbsp; can be ∼ 300 \texttimes{",10.1145/3604237.3626864,2023,,ACM
HDM-GNN: A Heterogeneous Dynamic Multi-view Graph Neural Network for Crime Prediction,"Smart cities have drawn a lot of interest in recent years, which employ Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled sensors to gather data from various sources and help enhance the quality of residents’ life in multiple areas, e.g. public safety. Accurate crime prediction is significant for public safety promotion. However, the complicated spatial-temporal dependencies make the task challenging, due to two aspects: 1) spatial dependency of crime includes correlations with spatially adjacent regions and underlying correlations with distant regions, e.g. mobility connectivity and functional similarity; 2) there are near-repeat and long-range temporal correlations between crime occurrences across time. Most existing studies fall short in tackling with multi-view correlations, since they usually treat them equally without consideration of different weights for these correlations. In this paper, we propose a novel model for region-level crime prediction named as Heterogeneous Dynamic Multi-view Graph Neural Network (HDM-GNN). The model can represent the dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies of crime with heterogeneous urban data, and fuse various types of region-wise correlations from multiple views. Global spatial dependencies and long-range temporal dependencies can be derived by integrating the multiple GAT modules and Gated CNN modules. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of our method using several real-world datasets. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Robust Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network for Electricity Consumption Forecasting,"Precise electricity consumption forecasting is pivotal in the energy schedule of new electric power systems. It is also significant for improving robustness of smart power grid. Existing multivariate time series predictions have made effective achievements in modeling sequential tendency and periodicity, but they lack of considering time series noises due to data sensing or transferring. Therefore, we focus on a robust approach to capture intricate correlations of multivariate time series data for forecasting. Specifically, we exploit gated dilated causal convolution as projection layer to capture latent semantic information from a temporal perspective. Furthermore, we combine time series decomposition and adaptive normalization to learn latent representations of each time series. Finally, we devise spatio-temporal modeling for capturing heterogeneous correlations. Extensive experiments are implemented on real-scenario public datasets. The performances show the effectiveness of proposed approach for electricity consumption forecasting.",10.1145/3697355.3697401,2024,,ACM
AutoCTS+: Joint Neural Architecture and Hyperparameter Search for Correlated Time Series Forecasting,"Sensors in cyber-physical systems often capture interconnected processes and thus emit correlated time series (CTS), the forecasting of which enables important applications. The key to successful CTS forecasting is to uncover the temporal dynamics of time series and the spatial correlations among time series. Deep learning-based solutions exhibit impressive performance at discerning these aspects. In particular, automated CTS forecasting, where the design of an optimal deep learning architecture is automated, enables forecasting accuracy that surpasses what has been achieved by manual approaches. However, automated CTS solutions remain in their infancy and are only able to find optimal architectures for predefined hyperparameters and scale poorly to large-scale CTS. To overcome these limitations, we propose AutoCTS+, a joint, scalable framework, to automatically devise effective CTS forecasting models. Specifically, we encode each candidate architecture and accompanying hyperparameters into a joint graph representation. We introduce an efficient Architecture-Hyperparameter Comparator (AHC) to rank all architecture-hyperparameter pairs, and we then further evaluate the top-ranked pairs to select an architecture-hyperparameter pair as the final model. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that AutoCTS+ not only eliminates manual efforts but also is capable of better performance than manually designed and existing automatically designed CTS models. In addition, it shows excellent scalability to large CTS.",10.1145/3588951,2023,,ACM
ODGS: Dependency-Aware Scheduling for High-Level Synthesis with Graph Neural Network and Reinforcement Learning,"Scheduling determines the execution order and time of operations in a program. The order is related to operation dependencies, including data and resource dependencies. Data dependency is intrinsic in a program, showing operation data flow. Resource dependency is determined by scheduling methods, resolving operation resource contention. Existing scheduling methods focus on data dependency, rather than building and exploiting operation dependency graph (ODG) with extra resource dependency. As ODG contains all dependencies determining operation execution order, it provides global program information, facilitating efficient scheduling. In this work, we propose ODGS, a dependency-aware scheduling method for high-level synthesis with graph neural network (GNN) and reinforcement learning (RL). We adopt GNN to perceive accurate relations between operations. We use the relations to guide an RL agent in building a complete ODG. We perform feedback-guided iterative scheduling with ODG to converge to a high-quality solution. Experiments show that our method reduces 16.4\% latency and 26.5\% resource usage on average, compared with the latest RL-based method. Moreover, we reduce an average 2.9\% latency over the GNN-based method under the same resource usage. The same resource usage is obtained by improving the GNN-based method with manual resource constraint tuning. Without tuning, its basic version consumes an average 237.6\% more resources than our method.",10.1145/3721289,2025,,ACM
Connecting the Dots: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Graph Neural Networks,"Modeling multivariate time series has long been a subject that has attracted researchers from a diverse range of fields including economics, finance, and traffic. A basic assumption behind multivariate time series forecasting is that its variables depend on one another but, upon looking closely, it is fair to say that existing methods fail to fully exploit latent spatial dependencies between pairs of variables. In recent years, meanwhile, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown high capability in handling relational dependencies. GNNs require well-defined graph structures for information propagation which means they cannot be applied directly for multivariate time series where the dependencies are not known in advance. In this paper, we propose a general graph neural network framework designed specifically for multivariate time series data. Our approach automatically extracts the uni-directed relations among variables through a graph learning module, into which external knowledge like variable attributes can be easily integrated. A novel mix-hop propagation layer and a dilated inception layer are further proposed to capture the spatial and temporal dependencies within the time series. The graph learning, graph convolution, and temporal convolution modules are jointly learned in an end-to-end framework. Experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods on 3 of 4 benchmark datasets and achieves on-par performance with other approaches on two traffic datasets which provide extra structural information.",10.1145/3394486.3403118,2020,,ACM
Integrating System State into Spatio Temporal Graph Neural Network for Microservice Workload Prediction,"Microservice architecture has become a driving force in enhancing the modularity and scalability of web applications, as evidenced by the Alipay platform's operational success. However, a prevalent issue within such infrastructures is the suboptimal utilization of CPU resources due to inflexible resource allocation policies. This inefficiency necessitates the development of dynamic, accurate workload prediction methods to improve resource allocation. In response to this challenge, we present STAMP, a &lt;u&gt;S&lt;/u&gt;patio &lt;u&gt;T&lt;/u&gt;emporal Gr&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;ph Network for &lt;u&gt;M&lt;/u&gt;icroservice Workload &lt;u&gt;P&lt;/u&gt;rediction. STAMP is designed to comprehensively address the multifaceted interdependencies between microservices, the temporal variability of workloads, and the critical role of system state in resource utilization. Through a graph-based representation, STAMP effectively maps the intricate network of microservice interactions. It employs time series analysis to capture the dynamic nature of workload changes and integrates system state insights to enhance prediction accuracy. Our empirical analysis, using three distinct real-world datasets, establishes that STAMP exceeds baselines by achieving an average boost of 5.72\% in prediction precision, as measured by RMSE. Upon deployment in Alipay's microservice environment, STAMP achieves a 33.10\% reduction in resource consumption, significantly outperforming existing online methods. This research solidifies STAMP as a validated framework, offering meaningful contributions to the field of resource management in microservice architecture-based applications.",10.1145/3637528.3671508,2024,,ACM
Data-Driven Time Series Forecasting for Social Studies Using Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks,"Time series forecasting with additional spatial information has attracted a tremendous amount of attention in recent research, due to its importance in various real-world applications on social studies, such as conflict prediction and pandemic forecasting. Conventional machine learning methods either consider temporal dependencies only, or treat spatial and temporal relations as two separate autoregressive models, namely, space-time autoregressive models. Such methods suffer when it comes to long-term forecasting or predictions for large-scale areas, due to the high nonlinearity and complexity of spatio-temporal data. In this paper, we propose to address these challenges using spatio-temporal graph neural networks. Empirical results on Violence Early Warning System (ViEWS) dataset and U.S. Covid-19 dataset indicate that our method significantly improved performance over the baseline approaches.",10.1145/3462203.3475929,2021,,ACM
BigST: Linear Complexity Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network for Traffic Forecasting on Large-Scale Road Networks,"Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (STGNN) has been used as a common workhorse for traffic forecasting. However, most of them require prohibitive quadratic computational complexity to capture long-range spatio-temporal dependencies, thus hindering their applications to long historical sequences on large-scale road networks in the real-world. To this end, in this paper, we propose BigST, a linear complexity spatio-temporal graph neural network, to efficiently exploit long-range spatio-temporal dependencies for large-scale traffic forecasting. Specifically, we first propose a scalable long sequence feature extractor to encode node-wise long-range inputs (e.g., thousands of time-steps in the past week) into low-dimensional representations encompassing rich temporal dynamics. The resulting representations can be pre-computed and hence significantly reduce the computational overhead for prediction. Then, we build a linearized global spatial convolution network to adaptively distill time-varying graph structures, which enables fast runtime message passing along spatial dimensions in linear complexity. We empirically evaluate our model on two large-scale real-world traffic datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BigST can scale to road networks with up to one hundred thousand nodes, while significantly improving prediction accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art traffic forecasting models.",10.14778/3641204.3641217,2024,,ACM
ST-CopulaGNN : A Multi-View Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network for Traffic Forecasting,"Modern cities heavily rely on complex transportation, making accurate traffic speed prediction crucial for traffic management authorities. Classical methods, including statistical techniques and traditional machine learning techniques, fail to capture complex relationships, while deep learning approaches may have weaknesses such as error accumulation, difficulty in handling long sequences, and overlooking spatial correlations. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise in extracting spatial features from non-Euclidean graph structures, but they usually initialize the adjacency matrix based on distance and may fail to detect hidden statistical correlations. The choice of correlation measure can have a significant impact on the resulting adjacency matrix and the effectiveness of graph-based models. This paper proposes a novel approach for accurately forecasting traffic patterns by utilizing a multi-view spatio-temporal graph neural network that captures data from both realistic and statistical domains. Unlike traditional correlation measures such as Pearson correlation, copula models are utilized to extract hidden statistical correlations and construct multivariate distribution functions to obtain the correlation relationship among traffic nodes. A two-step approach is adopted, which involves selecting and testing different types of bivariate copulas to identify the ones that best fit the traffic data, and utilizing these copulas to create multi-weight adjacency matrices. The second step involves utilizing a graph convolutional network to extract spatial information and capturing temporal trends using dilated causal convolutions. The proposed ST-CopulaGNN model outperforms other models in spatio-temporal traffic forecasting that solely rely on distance-based adjacency matrices, such as DCRNN and Graph WaveNet. It also achieves the lowest MAE for 30 and 60 minutes ahead and the lowest MAPE for 15 minutes ahead on the PEMS-BAY dataset. The model incorporates copulas, and the study explores copula function selection and the impact of using paired time-series with a time lag. The findings suggest that using copula-based adjacency matrix configurations, particularly those including Clayton and Gumbel copulas, can enhance traffic forecasting accuracy.",10.1145/3603719.3603740,2023,,ACM
Capturing Structural Evolution in Financial Markets with Graph Neural Time Series Models,"This paper proposes a stock price prediction method based on a graph neural network architecture. The method is designed to address key characteristics of the stock market, including high nonlinearity, multivariable dependencies, and dynamically changing structural relationships. It constructs a dynamic stock graph to represent the evolving relationship network among individual stocks over time. A temporal-aware graph neural network module is designed to jointly model node features through structural propagation and temporal dependence. Specifically, the model incorporates multi-source heterogeneous information to build the dynamic graph structure. This enables explicit representation of the time-varying linkages between stocks within the graph. Graph convolution is then applied to extract structural features at each time step. A temporal module is used to model the evolution of these features over time. To validate the effectiveness of the method, the model is compared with existing graph-based and time-series models across multiple evaluation metrics. Ablation studies, robustness tests, and performance assessments under different market conditions are conducted to comprehensively analyze the model's behavior in various scenarios. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves low prediction error while maintaining strong stability and generalization ability. It significantly improves the accuracy of modeling asset price trends in financial markets. This study provides a unified solution for structural and dynamic aspects of the stock prediction problem and extends the application scope of graph neural networks in financial time series analysis.",10.1145/3767052.3767086,2025,,ACM
Traffic Flow Prediction Using Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks Based on Hybrid Adaptive Feature Enhancement,"Aiming at the poor adaptation of most current models to dynamic maps and the difficulty in capturing long-term spatio-temporally relevant features, this paper proposes a hybrid adaptive feature-enhanced graph neural network (HAFEGNN) model. To address these challenges, we propose a new approach based on graph neural networks that integrates multiple state-of-the-art enhancement feature representation mechanisms. The model enhances the representation of dynamic spatio-temporal features by integrating multi-scale convolution, channel self-attention and spatial self-attention mechanisms. On top of that, temporal self-attention mechanism is also introduced to focus on learning long-term dependencies, which leads to better understanding of patterns in historical data and making more accurate predictions. The model further incorporates Dynamic Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (DGCRN) to capture spatio-temporal dynamics. To enhance the adaptability to dynamic graph structures, it integrates spatial location embedding with graph attention mechanisms to form a spatially aware module, which improves the prediction accuracy. Our experimental evaluation on the widely used PeMS04 and PeMS08 datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed HAFEGNN. The model achieves significant improvements in key metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and MAPE, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods and validating its ability to handle complex traffic data. This study provides a new solution for traffic flow prediction and demonstrates its potential in handling complex traffic data.",10.1145/3747227.3747240,2025,,ACM
TTS-Norm: Forecasting Tensor Time Series via Multi-Way Normalization,"Tensor time series (TTS) data, a generalization of one-dimensional time series on a high-dimensional space, is ubiquitous in real-world applications. Compared to modeling time series or multivariate time series, which has received much attention and achieved tremendous progress in recent years, tensor time series has been paid less effort. However, properly coping with the TTS is a much more challenging task, due to its high-dimensional and complex inner structure. In this article, we start by revealing the structure of TTS data from afn statistical view of point. Then, in line with this analysis, we perform Tensor Time Series forecasting via a proposed Multi-way Normalization (TTS-Norm), which effectively disentangles multiple heterogeneous low-dimensional substructures from the original high-dimensional structure. Finally, we design a novel objective function for TTS forecasting, accounting for the numerical heterogeneity among different low-dimensional subspaces of TTS. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets verify the superior performance of our proposed model.1",10.1145/3605894,2023,,ACM
Causality-Aware Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks for Spatiotemporal Time Series Imputation,"Spatiotemporal time series are usually collected via monitoring sensors placed at different locations, which usually contain missing values due to various failures, such as mechanical damages and Internet outages. Imputing the missing values is crucial for analyzing time series. When recovering a specific data point, most existing methods consider all the information relevant to that point regardless of the cause-and-effect relationship. During data collection, it is inevitable that some unknown confounders are included, e.g., background noise in time series and non-causal shortcut edges in the constructed sensor network. These confounders could open backdoor paths and establish non-causal correlations between the input and output. Over-exploiting these non-causal correlations could cause overfitting. In this paper, we first revisit spatiotemporal time series imputation from a causal perspective and show how to block the confounders via the frontdoor adjustment. Based on the results of frontdoor adjustment, we introduce a novel &lt;u&gt;C&lt;/u&gt;ausality-&lt;u&gt;A&lt;/u&gt;ware &lt;u&gt;Sp&lt;/u&gt;atiot&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;mpo&lt;u&gt;r&lt;/u&gt;al Graph Neural Network (Casper), which contains a novel Prompt Based Decoder (PBD) and a Spatiotemporal Causal Attention (SCA). PBD could reduce the impact of confounders and SCA could discover the sparse causal relationships among embeddings. Theoretical analysis reveals that SCA discovers causal relationships based on the values of gradients. We evaluate Casper on three real-world datasets, and the experimental results show that Casper could outperform the baselines and could effectively discover the causal relationships.",10.1145/3627673.3679642,2024,,ACM
Transformer-Based Financial Fraud Detection with Cloud-Optimized Real-Time Streaming,"As the financial industry becomes more interconnected and reliant on digital systems, fraud detection systems must evolve to meet growing threats. Cloud-enabled Transformer models present a transformative opportunity to address these challenges. By leveraging the scalability, flexibility, and advanced AI capabilities of cloud platforms, companies can deploy fraud detection solutions that adapt to real-time data patterns and proactively respond to evolving threats. Using the Graph self-attention Transformer neural network module, we can directly excavate gang fraud features from the transaction network without constructing complicated feature engineering. Finally, the fraud prediction network is combined to optimize the topological pattern and the temporal transaction pattern to realize the high-precision detection of fraudulent transactions. The results of anti-fraud experiments on credit card transaction data show that the proposed model outperforms the 7 baseline models on all evaluation indicators: In the transaction fraud detection task, the average accuracy (AP) increased by 20\% and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) increased by 2.7\% on average compared with the benchmark graph attention neural network (GAT), which verified the effectiveness of the proposed model in the detection of credit card fraud transactions.",10.1145/3724154.3724271,2025,,ACM
CMMD: Cross-Metric Multi-Dimensional Root Cause Analysis,"In large-scale online services, crucial metrics, a.k.a., key performance indicators (KPIs), are monitored periodically to check the running statuses. Generally, KPIs are aggregated along multiple dimensions and derived by complex calculations among fundamental metrics from the raw data. Once abnormal KPI values are observed, root cause analysis (RCA) can be applied to identify the reasons for anomalies, so that we can troubleshoot quickly. Recently, several automatic RCA techniques were proposed to localize the related dimensions (or a combination of dimensions) to explain the anomalies. However, their analyses are limited to the data on the abnormal metric and ignore the data of other metrics which are also related to the anomalies, leading to imprecise or even incorrect root causes. To this end, we propose a cross-metric multi-dimensional root cause analysis method, named CMMD, which consists of two key components: 1) relationship modeling, which utilizes graph neural network (GNN) to model the unknown complex calculation among metrics and aggregation function among dimensions from historical data; 2) root cause localization, which adopts the genetic algorithm to efficiently and effectively dive into the raw data and localize the abnormal dimension(s) once the KPI anomalies are detected. Experiments on synthetic datasets, real-world datasets and online production environments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed CMMD method compared with baselines. Currently, CMMD is running as an online service in Microsoft Azure.",10.1145/3534678.3539109,2022,,ACM
CrashFormer: A Multimodal Architecture to Predict the Risk of Crash,"Reducing traffic accidents is a crucial global public safety concern. Accident prediction is key to improving traffic safety, enabling proactive measures to be taken before a crash occurs, and informing safety policies, regulations, and targeted interventions. Despite numerous studies on accident prediction over the past decades, many have limitations in terms of generalizability, reproducibility, or feasibility for practical use due to input data or problem formulation. To address existing shortcomings, we propose Crash-Former, a multi-modal architecture that utilizes comprehensive (but relatively easy to obtain) inputs such as the history of accidents, weather information, map images, and demographic information. The model predicts the future risk of accidents on a reasonably acceptable cadence (i.e., every six hours) for a geographical location of 5.161 square kilometers. CrashFormer is composed of five components: a sequential encoder to utilize historical accidents and weather data, an image encoder to use map imagery data, a raw data encoder to utilize demographic information, a feature fusion module for aggregating the encoded features, and a classifier that accepts the aggregated data and makes predictions accordingly. Results from extensive real-world experiments in 10 major US cities show that CrashFormer outperforms state-of-the-art sequential and non-sequential models by 1.8\% in F1-score on average when using ",10.1145/3615900.3628769,2023,,ACM
Decoder-only Pre-training Enhancement for Spatio-temporal Traffic Forecasting,"Although spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) become widely used methods in traffic forecasting, they still encounter an issue named short-sightedness. Specifically, due to high model complexity and GPU memory usage, STGNNs are restricted to processing only very short input time series. This limited context often causes STGNNs to focus on local variations and overlook long-term patterns, leading to misinterpretation of time series trends. To tackle this issue, recent studies propose to perform mask reconstruction pre-training on traffic series to enhance STGNNs. However, we argue that mask reconstruction is a suboptimal pre-training paradigm for traffic forecasting, because there exists a great gap between pre-training and downstream forecasting, caused by their inconsistent training targets. To eliminate this gap, we propose a new pre-training paradigm named next patch prediction and prove its advantages from both empirical and theoretical perspectives. Based on this paradigm, we introduce a new framework called Decoder-only Pre-training Enhancement (DoP) to unleash the potential of traffic pre-training model. Specifically, DoP uses Transformer decoders as infrastructure, and leverages next patch prediction as target to conduct pre-training. In addition, we propose a new dual-view temporal embedding to fully capture temporal information and spatial spectral enhancement to model spatial information. After pre-training, DoP enhances existing STGNNs seamlessly with periodic enhancement mechanism. On four real-world traffic benchmarks, we demonstrate its start-of-the-art performance.",10.1145/3746252.3761432,2025,,ACM
Cross-Region Graph Convolutional Network with Periodicity Shift Adaptation for Wide-Area SST Prediction,"Accurate prediction of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) is of high importance in marine science, benefiting applications ranging from ecosystem protection to extreme weather forecasting and climate analysis. Wide-area SST usually shows diverse SST patterns in different sea areas due to the changes of temperature zones and the dynamics of ocean currents. However, existing studies on SST prediction often focus on small-area predictions and lack the consideration of diverse SST patterns. Furthermore, SST shows an annual periodicity, but the periodicity is not strictly adherent to an annual cycle. Existing SST prediction methods struggle to adapt to this non-strict periodicity. To address these two issues, we proposed the Cross-Region Graph Convolutional Network with Periodicity Shift Adaptation (RGCN-PSA) model which is equipped with the Cross-Region Graph Convolutional Network module and the Periodicity Shift Adaption module. The Cross-Region Graph Convolutional Network module enhances wide-area SST prediction by learning and incorporating diverse SST patterns. Meanwhile, the periodicity Shift Adaptation module accounts for the annual periodicity and enable the model to adapt to the possible temporal shift automatically. We conduct experiments on two real-world SST datasets, and the results demonstrate that our RGCN-PSA model obviously outperforms baseline models in terms of prediction accuracy. The code of RGCN-PSA model is available at .",10.1145/3735646,2025,,ACM
Divide and Conquer: Adaptive Graph Neural Networks Leveraging Sequence Factorization for IP Network,"Accurate IP network traffic prediction is vital for the efficient management of metropolitan area networks, allowing operators to foresee potential issues and maintain optimal service quality. Existing methods struggle with the complex spatio-temporal characteristics of traffic sequences and their dependence on precise network topology. To overcome these challenges, we propose an innovative prediction framework leveraging discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and a dual-channel adaptive spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (ASTGCN) with feature fusion : WASTGCN. We start with a divide-and-conquer approach, using a multilevel DWT to decompose multimodal traffic into simpler factor sequences. We then introduce an ASTGCN that learns spatial dependencies directly from the data, minimizing the need for predefined structures and reducing preprocessing. The ASTGCN features a dual-channel setup: one branch captures short-term events using temporal attention, while the other models long-term trends with temporal convolution, effectively analyzing temporal dynamics. A multi-head cross attention fusion module then integrates these features. Our experimental results show that this method surpasses traditional approaches in predictive accuracy and stability, without depending on physical topology, highlighting its potential for improved network planning and management.",10.1145/3708657.3708664,2025,,ACM
MulSTE: A Multi-view Spatio-temporal Learning Framework with Heterogeneous Event Fusion for Demand-supply Prediction,"Recently, integrated warehouse and distribution logistics systems are widely used in E-commerce industries to adjust to constantly changing customer demands. It makes the prediction of purchase demand and delivery supply capacity a crucial problem to streamline operations and improve efficiency. The interaction between such demand and supply not only relies on their economic relationships but also on consumer psychology caused by daily events, such as epidemics, promotions, and festivals. Although existing studies have made great efforts in the joint prediction of demand and supply considering modeling the demand-supply interactions, they seldom refer to the impacts of diverse events. In this work, we propose MulSTE, a Multi-view Spatio-Temporal learning framework with heterogeneous Event fusion. Firstly, an Event Fusion Representation (EFR) module is designed to fuse the textual, numerical, and categorical heterogeneous information for emergent and periodic events. Secondly, a Multi-graph Adaptive Convolution Recurrent Network (MGACRN) is developed as the spatio-temporal encoder (ST-Encoder) to capture the evolutional features of demand, supply, and events. Thirdly, the Event Gated Demand-Supply Interaction Attention (EGIA) module is designed to model the demand-supply interactions during events. The evaluations are conducted on two real-world datasets collected from JD Logistics and public websites. The experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various metrics.",10.1145/3637528.3672030,2024,,ACM
Spatio-Temporal Deep Fusion Graph Convolutional Networks for Crime Prediction,"Effective crime prediction plays a key role in sustaining the stability of society. In recent years, researchers have proposed a number of prediction methods that extract spatial and temporal features separately and fuse afterward. However, the strict distinction between spatial feature extraction and temporal feature extraction can result in the loss of useful information. To this end, we propose a spatio-temporal deep fusion graph convolution network (STDGCN), which embodies the intra-region spatio-temporal features and the inter-region spatio-temporal associations on a single graph. STDGCN performs the convolution without distinguishing between space and time to simultaneously extract spatio-temporal features. Our evaluations of two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of STDGCN.",10.1145/3583788.3583799,2023,,ACM
Characterizing and Forecasting Urban Vibrancy Evolution: A Multi-View Graph Mining Perspective,"Urban vibrancy describes the prosperity, diversity, and accessibility of urban areas, which is vital to a city’s socio-economic development and sustainability. While many efforts have been made for statically measuring and evaluating urban vibrancy, there are few studies on the evolutionary process of urban vibrancy, yet we know little about the relationship between urban vibrancy evolution and sophisticated spatiotemporal dynamics. In this article, we make use of multi-sourced urban data to develop a data-driven framework, U-Evolve, to investigate urban vibrancy evolution. Specifically, we first exploit the spatiotemporal characteristics of urban areas to create multi-view time-dependent graphs. Then, we analyze the contextual features and graph patterns of multi-view time-dependent graphs in terms of informing future urban vibrancy variations. Our analysis validates the informativeness of multi-view time-dependent graphs for characterizing and informing future urban vibrancy evolution. After that, we construct a feature based model to forecast future urban vibrancy evolution and quantify each feature’s importance. Moreover, to further enhance the forecasting effectiveness, we propose a graph learning based model to capture spatiotemporal autocorrelation of urban areas based on multi-view time-dependent graphs in an end-to-end manner. Finally, extensive experiments on two metropolises, Beijing and Shanghai, demonstrate the effectiveness of our forecasting models. The U-Evolve framework has also been deployed in the production environment to deliver real-world urban development and planning insights for various cities in China.",10.1145/3568683,2023,,ACM
Cola-GNN: Cross-location Attention based Graph Neural Networks for Long-term ILI Prediction,"Forecasting influenza-like illness (ILI) is of prime importance to epidemiologists and health-care providers. Early prediction of epidemic outbreaks plays a pivotal role in disease intervention and control. Most existing work has either limited long-term prediction performance or fails to capture spatio-temporal dependencies in data. In this paper, we design a cross-location attention based graph neural network (Cola-GNN) for learning time series embeddings in long-term ILI predictions. We propose a graph message passing framework to combine graph structures (e.g., geolocations) and time-series features (e.g., temporal sequences) in a dynamic propagation process. We compare the proposed method with state-of-the-art statistical approaches and deep learning models. We conducted a set of extensive experiments on real-world epidemic-related datasets from the United States and Japan. The proposed method demonstrated strong predictive performance and leads to interpretable results for long-term epidemic predictions.",10.1145/3340531.3411975,2020,,ACM
Context-aware Event Forecasting via Graph Disentanglement,"Event forecasting has been a demanding and challenging task throughout the entire human history. It plays a pivotal role in crisis alarming and disaster prevention in various aspects of the whole society. The task of event forecasting aims to model the relational and temporal patterns based on historical events and makes forecasting to what will happen in the future. Most existing studies on event forecasting formulate it as a problem of link prediction on temporal event graphs. However, such pure structured formulation suffers from two main limitations: 1) most events fall into general and high-level types in the event ontology, and therefore they tend to be coarse-grained and offers little utility which inevitably harms the forecasting accuracy; and 2) the events defined by a fixed ontology are unable to retain the out-of-ontology contextual information.To address these limitations, we propose a novel task of context-aware event forecasting which incorporates auxiliary contextual information. First, the categorical context provides supplementary fine-grained information to the coarse-grained events. Second and more importantly, the context provides additional information towards specific situation and condition, which is crucial or even determinant to what will happen next. However, it is challenging to properly integrate context into the event forecasting framework, considering the complex patterns in the multi-context scenario. Towards this end, we design a novel framework named Separation and Collaboration Graph Disentanglement (short as SeCoGD) for context-aware event forecasting. In the separation stage, we leverage the context as a prior guidance to disentangle the event graph into multiple sub-graphs, followed by a context-specific module to model the relational-temporal patterns within each context. In the collaboration stage, we design a cross-context module to retain the collaborative associations among multiple contexts. Since there is no available dataset for this novel task, we construct three large- scale datasets based on GDELT. Experimental results demonstrate hat our model outperforms a list of SOTA methods. The dataset and code are released via https://github.com/yecchen/SeCoGD.",10.1145/3580305.3599285,2023,,ACM
HierST: A Unified Hierarchical Spatial-temporal Framework for COVID-19 Trend Forecasting,"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has largely influenced the world and our normal daily lives. To combat this pandemic efficiently, governments usually need to coordinate essential resources across multiple regions and adjust intervention polices at the right time, which all call for accurate and robust forecasting of future epidemic trends. However, designing such a forecasting system is non-trivial, since we need to handle all kinds of locations at different administrative levels, which include pretty different epidemic-evolving patterns. Moreover, there are dynamic and volatile correlations of pandemic conditions among these locations, which further enlarge the difficulty in forecasting. With these challenges in mind, we develop a novel spatial-temporal forecasting framework. First, to accommodate all kinds of locations at different administrative levels, we propose a unified hierarchical view, which mimics the aggregation procedure of pandemic statistics. Then, this view motivates us to facilitate joint learning across administrative levels and inspires us to design the cross-level consistency loss as an extra regularization to stabilize model training. Besides, to capture those dynamic and volatile spatial correlations, we design a customized spatial module with adaptive edge gates, which can both reinforce effective messages and disable irrelevant ones. We put this framework into production to help the battle against COVID-19 in the United States. A comprehensive online evaluation across three months demonstrates that our projections are the most competitive ones among all results produced by dozens of international group and even surpass the official ensemble in many cases. We also visualize our unique edge gates to understand the evolvement of spatial correlations and present intuitive case studies. Besides, we open source our implementation at https://github.com/dolphin-zs/HierST to facilitate future research towards better epidemic modeling.",10.1145/3459637.3481927,2021,,ACM
Graph Neural Networks in IoT: A Survey,"The Internet of Things (IoT) boom has revolutionized almost every corner of people’s daily lives: healthcare, environment, transportation, manufacturing, supply chain, and so on. With the recent development of sensor and communication technology, IoT artifacts, including smart wearables, cameras, smartwatches, and autonomous systems can accurately measure and perceive their surrounding environment. Continuous sensing generates massive amounts of data and presents challenges for machine learning. Deep learning models (e.g., convolution neural networks and recurrent neural networks) have been extensively employed in solving IoT tasks by learning patterns from multi-modal sensory data. Graph neural networks (GNNs), an emerging and fast-growing family of neural network models, can capture complex interactions within sensor topology and have been demonstrated to achieve state-of-the-art results in numerous IoT learning tasks. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of recent advances in the application of GNNs to the IoT field, including a deep dive analysis of GNN design in various IoT sensing environments, an overarching list of public data and source codes from the collected publications, and future research directions.

Learning knowledge-enriched company embeddings for investment management,"Relationships between companies serve as key channels through which the effects of past stock price movements and news events propagate and influence future price movements. Such relationships can be implicitly found in knowledge bases or explicitly represented as knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose Knowledge-Enriched Company Embedding (KECE), a novel multi-stage attention-based dynamic network embedding model combining multimodal information of companies with knowledge from Wikipedia and knowledge graph relationships from Wikidata to generate company entity embeddings that can be applied to a variety of downstream investment management tasks. Experiments on an extensive set of real-world stock prices and news datasets show that the proposed KECE model outperforms other state-of-the-art models on key investment management tasks.",10.1145/3490354.3494390,2022,,ACM
Learning Reliable User Representations from Volatile and Sparse Data to Accurately Predict Customer Lifetime Value,"In industry, customer lifetime value (LTV) prediction is a challenging task, since user consumption data is usually volatile, noisy, or sparse. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel Temporal-Structural User Representation (named TSUR) network to predict LTV. We utilize historical revenue time series and user attributes to learn both temporal and structural user representations, respectively. Specifically, the temporal representation is learned with a temporal trend encoder based on a novel multi-channel Discrete Wavelet Transform~(DWT) module, while the structural representation is derived with Graph Attention Network (GAT) on an attribute similarity graph. Furthermore, a novel cluster-alignment regularization method is employed to align and enhance these two kinds of representations. In essence, such a fusion way can be considered as the association of temporal and structural representations in the low-pass representation space, which is also useful to prevent the data noise from being transferred across different views. To our knowledge, it is the first time that temporal and structural user representations are jointly learned for LTV prediction. Extensive offline experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets and online A/B tests have shown the superiority of our approach over a number of competitive baselines.",10.1145/3447548.3467079,2021,,ACM
Data Quality-based Gradient Optimization for Recurrent Neural Networks,"Time series forecasting holds significant value in various application scenarios. However, existing forecasting methods primarily focus on optimizing model architecture while neglecting the substantial impact of data quality on model learning. In this study, we aim to enhance model performance by optimizing data utilization based on data quality and propose a Data Quality-based Gradient Optimization (DQGO) method to facilitate training of recurrent neural networks. Firstly, we define sample quality as the matching degree between samples and model, and suggest using the attention entropy to calculate the sample quality through an attention mechanism. Secondly, we optimize the model's gradient vector by giving different weights to samples with different quality. Through experiments conducted on six datasets, the results demonstrate that DQGO significantly improves LSTM's performance. In certain cases, it even surpasses the state-of-the-art models.",10.1145/3589335.3651918,2024,,ACM
Forecasting at Full Spectrum: Holistic Multi-Granular Traffic Modeling under High-Throughput Inference Regimes,"Notably, current intelligent transportation systems rely heavily on accurate traffic forecasting and swift inference provision to make timely decisions. While Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have shown benefits in modeling complex traffic dependencies, the existing GCN-based approaches cannot fully extract and fuse multi-granular spatiotemporal features across various spatial and temporal scales sufficiently in a complete manner, proven to yield less accurate results. As extracting multi-granular features across scales has been a promising strategy across domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, and time-series forecasting, pioneering studies have attempted to leverage a similar mechanism for spatiotemporal traffic data mining. However, additional feature extraction branches introduced in prior studies critically increased model complexity and extended inference time, making it challenging to provide fast forecasts. In this paper, we propose MultiGran-STGCNFog, an efficient fog distributed inference system with a novel traffic forecasting model that employs multi-granular spatiotemporal feature fusion on generated dynamic traffic graphs to fully capture interdependent traffic dynamics. The proposed scheduling algorithm GA-DPHDS, optimizing layer execution order and layer-device scheduling scheme simultaneously, contributes to considerable inference throughput improvement by coordinating heterogeneous fog devices in a pipelined manner. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over selected GCN baselines.",10.1145/3746252.3761330,2025,,ACM
Graph Neural Rough Differential Equations for Traffic Forecasting,"Traffic forecasting is one of the most popular spatio-temporal tasks in the field of machine learning. A prevalent approach in the field is to combine graph convolutional networks and recurrent neural networks for the spatio-temporal processing. There has been fierce competition and many novel methods have been proposed. In this article, we present the method of spatio-temporal graph neural rough differential equation (STG-NRDE). Neural rough differential equations (NRDEs) are a breakthrough concept for processing time-series data. Their main concept is to use the log-signature transform to convert a time-series sample into a relatively shorter series of feature vectors. We extend the concept and design two NRDEs: one for the temporal processing and the other for the spatial processing. After that, we combine them into a single framework. We conduct experiments with 6 benchmark datasets and 27 baselines. STG-NRDE shows the best accuracy in all cases, outperforming all those 27 baselines by non-trivial margins.",10.1145/3604808,2023,,ACM
Graph Deep Factors for Forecasting with Applications to Cloud Resource Allocation,"Deep probabilistic forecasting techniques have recently been proposed for modeling large collections of time-series. However, these techniques explicitly assume either complete independence (local model) or complete dependence (global model) between time-series in the collection. This corresponds to the two extreme cases where every time-series is disconnected from every other time-series in the collection or likewise, that every time-series is related to every other time-series resulting in a completely connected graph. In this work, we propose a deep hybrid probabilistic graph-based forecasting framework called Graph Deep Factors (GraphDF) that goes beyond these two extremes by allowing nodes and their time-series to be connected to others in an arbitrary fashion. GraphDF is a hybrid forecasting framework that consists of a relational global and relational local model. In particular, we propose a relational global model that learns complex non-linear time-series patterns globally using the structure of the graph to improve both forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency. Similarly, instead of modeling every time-series independently, we learn a relational local model that not only considers its individual time-series but also the time-series of nodes that are connected in the graph. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed deep hybrid graph-based forecasting model compared to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of its forecasting accuracy, runtime, and scalability. Our case study reveals that GraphDF can successfully generate cloud usage forecasts and opportunistically schedule workloads to increase cloud cluster utilization by 47.5\% on average.",10.1145/3447548.3467357,2021,,ACM
Disentangled Dynamic Graph Attention Network for Out-of-Distribution Sequential Recommendation,"Sequential recommendation, leveraging user-item interaction histories to provide personalized and timely suggestions, has drawn significant research interest recently. With the power of exploiting spatio-temporal dynamics, Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DyGNNs) show great potential in sequential recommendation by modeling the dynamic relationship between users and items. However, spatio-temporal distribution shifts naturally exist in out-of-distribution sequential recommendation, where both user-item relationships and temporal sequences demonstrate pattern shifts. The out-of-distribution scenarios may lead to the failure of existing DyGNNs in handling spatio-temporal distribution shifts in sequential recommendation, given that the patterns they exploit tend to be variant w.r.t labels under distribution shifts. In this article, we propose Disentangled Intervention-based Dynamic graph Attention networks with Invariance Promotion (I-DIDA) to handle spatio-temporal distribution shifts in sequential recommendation by discovering and utilizing invariant patterns, i.e., structures and features whose predictive abilities are stable across distribution shifts. Specifically, we first propose a disentangled spatio-temporal attention network to capture the variant and invariant patterns. By utilizing the disentangled patterns, we design a spatio-temporal intervention mechanism to create multiple interventional distributions and an environment inference module to infer the latent spatio-temporal environments, and minimize the invariance loss to leverage the invariant patterns with stable predictive abilities under distribution shifts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art sequential recommendation baselines under distribution shifts.",10.1145/3701988,2024,,ACM
3DGCN: 3-Dimensional Dynamic Graph Convolutional Network for Citywide Crowd Flow Prediction,"Crowd flow prediction is an essential task benefiting a wide range of applications for the transportation system and public safety. However, it is a challenging problem due to the complex spatio-temporal dependence and the complicated impact of urban structure on the crowd flow patterns. In this article, we propose a novel framework, 3-Dimensional Graph Convolution Network (3DGCN), to predict citywide crowd flow. We first model it as a dynamic spatio-temporal graph prediction problem, where each node represents a region with time-varying flows, and each edge represents the origin–destination (OD) flow between its corresponding regions. As such, OD flows among regions are treated as a proxy for the spatial interactions among regions. To tackle the complex spatio-temporal dependence, our proposed 3DGCN can model the correlation among graph spatial and temporal neighbors simultaneously. To learn and incorporate urban structures in crowd flow prediction, we design the GCN aggregator to be learned from both crowd flow prediction and region function inference at the same time. Extensive experiments with real-world datasets in two cities demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 9.6\%∼19.5\% for the next-time-interval prediction.",10.1145/3451394,2021,,ACM
Securities Price Movement Prediction Based on Graph Neural Networks,"Securities play a crucial role in the modern economy. However, securities price movement prediction, a type of time-series forecasting problem, remains challenging. This paper suggests that the underutilization of temporal structural information in the data hinders the improvement of accuracy in securities price movement prediction. Therefore, this paper proposes a securities price movement prediction method based on graph computing. By abstracting trading days and the temporal relationships between them as nodes and edges, the method transforms historical trading data into graph data. Subsequently, graph neural networks (GNN) are used to process the graph data and make predictions about stock price movements. Experiments show that the proposed method effectively improves the performance of price movement prediction. Thus, the proposed method is a simple, effective way to utilize time-series data and holds substantial value in securities price movement prediction.",10.1145/3650215.3650345,2024,,ACM

SeLeP: Learning Based Semantic Prefetching for Exploratory Database Workloads,"Prefetching is a crucial technique employed in traditional databases to enhance interactivity, particularly in the context of data exploration. Data exploration is a query processing paradigm in which users search for insights buried in the data, often not knowing what exactly they are looking for. Data exploratory tools deal with multiple challenges such as the need for interactivity with no a priori knowledge being present to help with the system tuning. The state-of-the-art prefetchers are specifically designed for navigational workloads only, where the number of possible actions is limited. The prefetchers that work with SQL-based workloads, on the other hand, mainly rely on data logical addresses rather than the data semantics. They fail to predict complex access patterns in cases where the database size is substantial, resulting in an extensive address space, or when there is frequent co-accessing of data. In this paper, we propose SeLeP, a semantic prefetcher that makes prefetching decisions for both types of workloads, based on the encoding of the data values contained inside the accessed blocks. Following the popular path of using machine learning approaches to automatically learn the hidden patterns, we formulate the prefetching task as a time-series forecasting problem and use an encoder-decoder LSTM architecture to learn the data access pattern. Our extensive experiments, across real-life exploratory workloads, demonstrate that SeLeP improves the hit ratio up to 40\% and reduces I/O time up to 45\% compared to the state-of-the-art, attaining 96\% hit ratio and 84\% I/O reduction on average.",10.14778/3659437.3659458,2024,,ACM
LINet: A Location and Intention-Aware Neural Network for Hotel Group Recommendation,"Motivated by the collaboration with Fliggy1, a leading Online Travel Platform (OTP), we investigate an important but less explored research topic about optimizing the quality of hotel supply, namely selecting potential profitable hotels in advance to build up adequate room inventory. We formulate a WWW problem, i.e., within a specific time period (When) and potential travel area (Where), which hotels should be recommended to a certain group of users with similar travel intentions (Why). We identify three critical challenges in solving the WWW problem: user groups generation, travel data sparsity and utilization of hotel recommendation information (e.g., period, location and intention). To this end, we propose LINet, a Location and Intention-aware neural Network for hotel group recommendation. Specifically, LINet first identifies user travel intentions for user groups generalization, and then characterizes the group preferences by jointly considering historical user-hotel interaction and spatio-temporal features of hotels. For data sparsity, we develop a graph neural network, which employs long-term data, and further design an auxiliary loss function of location that efficiently exploits data within the same and across different locations. Both offline and online experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LINet when compared with state-of-the-art methods. LINet has been successfully deployed on Fliggy to retrieve high quality hotels for business development, serving hundreds of hotel operation scenarios and thousands of hotel operators.",10.1145/3543507.3583202,2023,,ACM
DHFM: Diversity-Enhanced Hypergraph Factorization Machines for Feature Interaction Modeling,"Feature interaction modeling, which exploits interactive information between features, has been widely explored in various applications. Recently, many graph neural network (GNN)-based models are proposed to model feature interactions by predicting the existence of edges between pairwise nodes that represent features. However, these models can only directly model 2-order feature interactions. Although stacking multiple GNN layers can implicitly capture the arbitrary high-order feature interactions, it may lead to the over-smoothing problem. To this end, we propose Diversity-Enhanced Hypergraph Factorization Machines (DHFMs) that incorporate hypergraphs into feature interaction modeling, which can model the diverse feature interactions of different orders explicitly. Specifically, the order-wise hyperedge predictors are proposed to discover beneficial feature interactions and explicitly model the feature interactions of different orders. In addition, diversity measures are introduced in hyperedge predictors and in the results of feature interactions to make discovered feature interactions as diverse as possible and avoid generating correlated errors. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model. In addition, the case study is conducted to further justify the effectiveness of the proposed model.",10.1145/3721982,2025,,ACM
Multi-Temporal Relationship Inference in Urban Areas,"Finding multiple temporal relationships among locations can benefit a bunch of urban applications, such as dynamic offline advertising and smart public transport planning. While some efforts have been made on finding static relationships among locations, little attention is focused on studying time-aware location relationships. Indeed, abundant location-based human activities are time-varying and the availability of these data enables a new paradigm for understanding the dynamic relationships in a period among connective locations. To this end, we propose to study a new problem, namely multi-Temporal relationship inference among locations (Trial for short), where the major challenge is how to integrate dynamic and geographical influence under the relationship sparsity constraint. Specifically, we propose a solution to Trial with a graph learning scheme, which includes a spatially evolving graph neural network (SEENet) with two collaborative components: spatially evolving graph convolution module (SEConv) and spatially evolving self-supervised learning strategy (SE-SSL). SEConv performs the intra-time aggregation and inter-time propagation to capture the multifaceted spatially evolving contexts from the view of location message passing. In addition, SE-SSL designs time-aware self-supervised learning tasks in a global-local manner with additional evolving constraint to enhance the location representation learning and further handle the relationship sparsity. Finally, experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over several state-of-the-art approaches.",10.1145/3580305.3599440,2023,,ACM
Automated Spatio-Temporal Synchronous Modeling with Multiple Graphs for Traffic Prediction,"Traffic prediction plays an important role in many intelligent transportation systems. Many existing works design static neural network architecture to capture complex spatio-temporal correlations, which is hard to adapt to different datasets. Although recent neural architecture search approaches have addressed this problem, it still adopts a coarse-grained search with pre-defined and fixed components in the search space for spatio-temporal modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel neural architecture search framework, entitled AutoSTS, for automated spatio-temporal synchronous modeling in traffic prediction. To be specific, we design a graph neural network (GNN) based architecture search module to capture localized spatio-temporal correlations, where multiple graphs built from different perspectives are jointly utilized to find a better message passing way for mining such correlations. Further, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) based architecture search module to capture temporal dependencies with various ranges, where gated temporal convolutions with different kernel sizes and convolution types are designed in search space. Extensive experiments on six public datasets demonstrate that our model can achieve 4\%-10\% improvements compared with other methods.",10.1145/3511808.3557243,2022,,ACM
Score-based Graph Learning for Urban Flow Prediction,"Accurate urban flow prediction (UFP) is crucial for a range of smart city applications such as traffic management, urban planning, and risk assessment. To capture the intrinsic characteristics of urban flow, recent efforts have utilized spatial and temporal graph neural networks to deal with the complex dependence between the traffic in adjacent areas. However, existing graph neural network based approaches suffer from several critical drawbacks, including improper graph representation of urban traffic data, lack of semantic correlation modeling among graph nodes, and coarse-grained exploitation of external factors. To address these issues, we propose DiffUFP, a novel probabilistic graph-based framework for UFP. DiffUFP&nbsp;consists of two key designs: (1) a semantic region dynamic extraction method that effectively captures the underlying traffic network topology, and (2) a conditional denoising score-based adjacency matrix generator that takes spatial, temporal, and external factors into account when constructing the adjacency matrix rather than simply concatenation in existing studies. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of DiffUFP&nbsp;over the state-of-the-art UFP&nbsp;models and the effect of the two specific modules.",10.1145/3655629,2024,,ACM
DS-TPU: Dynamical System for on-Device Lifelong Graph Learning with Nonlinear Node Interaction,"Graph learning on dynamical systems has recently surfaced as an emerging research domain. By leveraging a novel electronic Dynamical System (DS), various graph learning challenges have been effectively tackled through a rapid, spontaneous natural annealing process. This method has attracted increasing attention due to its orders-of-magnitude improvements in speed and energy efficiency compared to traditional Graph Neural Network (GNN) approaches for inference tasks. However, (1) the current DS hardware only supports inference, missing its native solution for training; while relying on conventional hardware is likely more expensive than GNNs. (2) The current DS architecture only allows linear interactions among its nodes, limiting training accuracy.In this work, we present a Dynamical-System Training-Processing Unit (DS-TPU) developed through algorithm-architecture co-design to tackle the two major challenges: (1) An on-device lifelong learning mechanism that leverages feedback electric current as the loss function in response to the observed training data, allowing electron-speed refinement on the present model parameters. (2) A nonlinear DS node interaction mechanism constructed from Chebyshev polynomials to significantly improve the compatibility between the DS hardware and the embedded relation of graph data. Extensive evaluations using six real-world graph learning applications demonstrate that for accuracy, DS-TPU achieves 10.8\% MAE reduction over the best results of five widely used GNNs. In terms of training performance, the 5-Watt DS-TPU architecture achieves on-average 810 \texttimes{",10.1145/3695053.3731091,2025,,ACM
Real Time Index and Search Across Large Quantities of GNN Experts for Low Latency Online Learning,"Online learning is a powerful technique that allows models to adjust to concept drift in dynamically changing graphs. This approach is crucial for large mobility-based companies like Grab, where batch-learning methods fail to keep up with the large amount of training data. Our work focuses on scaling graph neural network mixture of expert (MoE) models for real-time traffic speed prediction on road networks, while meeting high accuracy and low latency requirements. Conventional spatio-temporal and incremental MoE frameworks struggle with poor inference accuracy and linear time complexity when scaling experts, for the latter, leading to prohibitively high latency in model updates. To address this issue, we introduce the Indexed Router, a novel method that categorizes experts into a structured hierarchy called the indexed tree. This approach reduces the time to scale and search N number of experts from O(N) to O(log N), making it ideal for online learning under tight service level agreements. Our experiments show that these time savings do not compromise inference accuracy, and our Indexed Router outperforms state-of-the-art spatio-temporal and incremental MoE models in terms of traffic speed prediction accuracy on real-life GPS traces from Grab's database and publicly available records. In summary, the Indexed Router enables MoE models to scale across large numbers of experts with low latency, while accurately identifying the relevant experts for inference.",10.1145/3580305.3599893,2023,,ACM
"Radflow: A Recurrent, Aggregated, and Decomposable Model for Networks of Time Series","We propose a new model for networks of time series that influence each other. Graph structures among time series are found in diverse domains, such as web traffic influenced by hyperlinks, product sales influenced by recommendation, or urban transport volume influenced by road networks and weather. There has been recent progress in graph modeling and in time series forecasting, respectively, but an expressive and scalable approach for a network of series does not yet exist. We introduce Radflow, a novel model that embodies three key ideas: a recurrent neural network to obtain node embeddings that depend on time, the aggregation of the flow of influence from neighboring nodes with multi-head attention, and the multi-layer decomposition of time series. Radflow naturally takes into account dynamic networks where nodes and edges change over time, and it can be used for prediction and data imputation tasks. On real-world datasets ranging from a few hundred to a few hundred thousand nodes, we observe that Radflow variants are the best performing model across a wide range of settings. The recurrent component in Radflow also outperforms N-BEATS, the state-of-the-art time series model. We show that Radflow can learn different trends and seasonal patterns, that it is robust to missing nodes and edges, and that correlated temporal patterns among network neighbors reflect influence strength. We curate WikiTraffic, the largest dynamic network of time series with 366K nodes and 22M time-dependent links spanning five years. This dataset provides an open benchmark for developing models in this area, with applications that include optimizing resources for the web. More broadly, Radflow has the potential to improve forecasts in correlated time series networks such as the stock market, and impute missing measurements in geographically dispersed networks of natural phenomena.",10.1145/3442381.3449945,2021,,ACM
Online Purchase Prediction via Multi-Scale Modeling of Behavior Dynamics,"Online purchase forecasting is of great importance in e-commerce platforms, which is the basis of how to present personalized interesting product lists to individual customers. However, predicting online purchases is not trivial as it is influenced by many factors including: (i) the complex temporal pattern with hierarchical inter-correlations; (ii) arbitrary category dependencies. To address these factors, we develop a Graph Multi-Scale Pyramid Networks (GMP) framework to fully exploit users' latent behavioral patterns with both multi-scale temporal dynamics and arbitrary inter-dependencies among product categories. In GMP, we first design a multi-scale pyramid modulation network architecture which seamlessly preserves the underlying hierarchical temporal factors--governing users' purchase behaviors. Then, we employ convolution recurrent neural network to encode the categorical temporal pattern at each scale. After that, we develop a resolution-wise recalibration gating mechanism to automatically re-weight the importance of each scale-view representations. Finally, a context-graph neural network module is proposed to adaptively uncover complex dependencies among category-specific purchases. Extensive experiments on real-world e-commerce datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method over state-of-the-art baselines across various settings.",10.1145/3292500.3330790,2019,,ACM
BiLSTM-KAN: A Time Series-based Traffic Flow Forecasting Model,"Currently, the task of traffic flow prediction poses a significant challenge. Most existing works utilize spatial features for overall forecasting, without giving much consideration to the issue of extracting data features from individual time series data. In the absence of knowledge about road topology, extracting effective time series features for a single node becomes particularly important. The BiLSTM-KAN model proposed in this paper is an innovative sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) forecasting model designed to significantly enhance the accuracy and efficiency of time series data processing. This model deeply integrates the advanced feature extraction capabilities of Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (BiLSTM) with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), forming a unique and powerful data processing mechanism. With the application of the BiLSTM-KAN model, it will be possible to more accurately capture the complex dynamic changes and underlying patterns in time series data, thereby providing more reliable and precise forecasting results for traffic flow prediction and other related field sequence data processing tasks.",10.1145/3704323.3704369,2025,,ACM
Time-Series Event Prediction with Evolutionary State Graph,"The accurate and interpretable prediction of future events in time-series data often requires the capturing of representative patterns (or referred to as states) underpinning the observed data. To this end, most existing studies focus on the representation and recognition of states, but ignore the changing transitional relations among them. In this paper, we present evolutionary state graph, a dynamic graph structure designed to systematically represent the evolving relations (edges) among states (nodes) along time. We conduct analysis on the dynamic graphs constructed from the time-series data and show that changes on the graph structures (e.g., edges connecting certain state nodes) can inform the occurrences of events (i.e., time-series fluctuation). Inspired by this, we propose a novel graph neural network model, Evolutionary State Graph Network (EvoNet), to encode the evolutionary state graph for accurate and interpretable time-series event prediction. Specifically, EvoNet models both the node-level (state-to-state) and graph-level (segment-to-segment) propagation, and captures the node-graph (state-to-segment) interactions over time. Experimental results based on five real-world datasets show that our approach not only achieves clear improvements compared with 11 baselines, but also provides more insights towards explaining the results of event predictions.",10.1145/3437963.3441827,2021,,ACM
Forecasting Interaction Order on Temporal Graphs,"Link prediction is a fundamental task for graph analysis and the topic has been studied extensively for static or dynamic graphs. Essentially, the link prediction is formulated as a binary classification problem about two nodes. However, for temporal graphs, links (or interactions) among node sets appear in sequential orders. And the orders may lead to interesting applications. While a binary link prediction formulation fails to handle such an order-sensitive case. In this paper, we focus on such an interaction order prediction problem among a given node set on temporal graphs. For the technical aspect, we develop a graph neural network model named Temporal ATtention network (TAT), which utilizes the fine-grained time information on temporal graphs by encoding continuous real-valued timestamps as vectors. For each transformation layer of the model, we devise an attention mechanism to aggregate neighborhoods' information based on their representations and time encodings attached to their specific edges. We also propose a novel training scheme to address the permutation-sensitive property of the problem. Experiments on several real-world temporal graphs reveal that TAT outperforms some state-of-the-art graph neural networks by 55\% on average under the AUC metric.",10.1145/3447548.3467341,2021,,ACM
Spatio-Temporal Wavelet Enhanced Attention Mamba for Stock Price Forecasting,"Stock price forecasting remains a critical challenge due to market non-stationarity and the influence of multiple factors. Existing studies apply frequency domain analysis methods to mitigate the impacts of non-stationarity by decoupling high- and low-frequency variation patterns. However, these approaches primarily focus on single series decomposition while neglecting cross frequency interactions among different stocks. Moreover, as a key indicator of overall market trends, current methods inadequately utilize market index information. In this paper, we propose STEAM, a Spatio-Temporal Wavelet Enhanced Attention Mamba model. We introduce Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to disentangle multi-frequency temporal features and propose Wavelet Enhanced Attention (WEA) to capture cross frequency spatial dependencies, effectively leveraging both local and global inter-stock relationships. To extract the synergistic spatio-temporal dependencies in stock data, AMamba module is designed that integrates WEA into the Mamba-2 architecture. Additionally, to further enhance the model's perception of macro-market conditions, we incorporate market index as a prefix, guiding predictions with holistic market information in both spatial and temporal dependencies learning. Extensive experiments across multiple national stock markets demonstrate that STEAM achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance.",10.1145/3746252.3761399,2025,,ACM
AutoSTF: Decoupled Neural Architecture Search for Cost-Effective Automated Spatio-Temporal Forecasting,"Spatio-temporal forecasting is a critical component of various smart city applications, such as transportation optimization, energy management, and socio-economic analysis. Recently, several automated spatio-temporal forecasting methods have been proposed to automatically search the optimal neural network architecture for capturing complex spatio-temporal dependencies. However, the existing automated approaches suffer from expensive neural architecture search overhead, which hinders their practical use and the further exploration of diverse spatio-temporal operators in a finer granularity. In this paper, we propose AutoSTF, a decoupled automatic neural architecture search framework for cost-effective automated spatio-temporal forecasting. From the efficiency perspective, we first decouple the mixed search space into temporal space and spatial space and respectively devise representation compression and parameter-sharing schemes to mitigate the parameter explosion. The decoupled spatio-temporal search not only expedites the model optimization process but also leaves new room for more effective spatio-temporal dependency modeling. From the effectiveness perspective, we propose a multi-patch transfer module to jointly capture multi-granularity temporal dependencies and extend the spatial search space to enable finer-grained layer-wise spatial dependency search. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate the superiority of AutoSTF in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, our proposed method achieves up to 13.48x speed-up compared to state-of-the-art automatic spatio-temporal forecasting methods while maintaining the best forecasting accuracy.

DecisionFlow for SMEs: A Lightweight Visual Framework for Multi-Task Joint Prediction and Anomaly Detection,"The digital transformation of industry has placed immense pressure on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which often lack the resources and technical infrastructure to adopt complex AI pipelines and data visualization systems. This creates a pressing challenge: how can SMEs leverage real-time business intelligence without heavy computational or financial burdens. We propose the DecisionFlow framework to generate interactive KPI dashboards on the fly using Vega-Lite declarative syntax through a low-latency visualization engine. To run at the edge, we distilled the long sequence of self-attention into linear Performer blocks, using cross-prediction step weight sharing and 8-bit quantization, so that the model only contained 4.3 M parameters and could be deployed on a common CPU or browser WebAssembly environment. Secondly, the model couples continuous probability prediction with rare event detection with a joint uncertainty loss function, as well as a cross-layer visual feedback closed-loop in which the user interacts with real-time update of the attention mask, so as to support online incremental learning. On Online Retail II (UCI), a dataset for SMEs, DecisionFlow reduced inference latency by 68\%, demand forecasting MAE by 17\%, and anomaly detection F1 to 0.91.",10.1145/3770177.3770325,2025,,ACM
ASTNet: Asynchronous Spatio-Temporal Network for Large-Scale Chemical Sensor Forecasting,"The chemical industry is faced with the urgent challenge of effectively harnessing the vast amounts of time-series data generated by thousands of sensors, which is essential for forecasting chemical states, achieving accurate real-time control of production processes. Traditional forecasting methods suffer from high computational latency and struggle with the complexity of spatiotemporal dependencies. As a result, modeling this data becomes challenging. This paper introduces a novel approach, referred to as ASTNet, designed to address these challenges. ASTNet integrates an asynchronous spatiotemporal modeling framework that combines temporal and spatial encoders, enabling concurrent learning of temporal and spatial dependencies while reducing computational latency. Additionally, it introduces a gated graph fusion mechanism that adaptively combines static (meta) and evolving (dynamic) sensor graphs, enhancing the handling of heterogeneous sensor data and spatial correlations. Extensive experiments on three real-world chemical sensor datasets demonstrate that ASTNet outperforms SOTA methods in terms of both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, making ASTNet successfully deployed in chemical engineering industrial scenarios.",10.1145/3711896.3737194,2025,,ACM
Pre-trained Time Series Foundation Models for Traffic Flow Prediction Using Open Government Data: The case of Attica traffic OGD,"Rapid urbanization and increase in vehicular traffic in metropolitan areas necessitate advanced predictive models to enhance traffic management systems. Open Government Data (OGD) portals provide accessible, high-quality traffic datasets, offering a valuable resource for developing and evaluating such models. This paper investigates the effectiveness of pre-trained Time Series Foundation Models, specifically Lag-Llama, in forecasting urban traffic flow using open government traffic data from the Greek OGD portal. We assess Lag-Llama’s performance in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings and compare it with traditional deep learning models, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our experimental results demonstrate that Lag-Llama, especially when fine-tuned on traffic OGD, outperforms conventional models in prediction accuracy. These findings highlight the potential of combining foundation models with traffic open government data to advance intelligent transportation systems and contribute to the development of more robust and reliable traffic forecasting models, as well as provide innovative and efficient public services for citizens and businesses.",10.1145/3716554.3716619,2025,,ACM
Generative Imputation with Multi-level Causal Consistency for Variable Subset Forecasting,"Variable Subset Forecasting (VSF) poses critical challenges in time series analysis when entire variables become unavailable during inference. Existing imputation methods relying on inter-variable correlations fail catastrophically in VSF due to two inherent limitations: (1) Missing variable collapse, where the complete absence of certain variables invalidates correlation-based dependency learning, and (2) Temporal covariate shift, where time-evolving data distributions destabilize correlation patterns learned from training data. To address these fundamental issues, we propose Generative Imputation with Multi-level Causal Consistency (GIMCC ), establishing causality-driven imputation as the first principled solution for VSF. Our key innovation lies in enforcing causal invariance through dual consistency constraints: global causal isomorphism ensures the imputed variables preserve the ground-truth causal graph structure of the complete system, while local causal subgraph alignment maintains consistency between observed variables and their causal neighborhood dependencies. By decoupling causality from spurious correlations, GIMCC provides time-invariant imputation signals robust to distribution shifts, which explicitly preserves causal relationships via multivariate spectral convolutions. Extensive experiments across five real-world domains demonstrate that GIMCC achieves average improvements of 20-60\% in MAE/RMSE over correlation-based imputation baselines, remarkably outperforming full-variable training ( Oracle ) in temporal covariate shift scenarios. Our work bridges the critical gap between causal analysis and practical forecasting systems under variable absence, offering theoretically grounded guarantees for real-world deployment.",10.1145/3711896.3736980,2025,,ACM
Architectural Bias vs. Feature Engineering: Deconstructing the Limits of Tabular Foundation Models in Traffic Forecasting,"Although spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) demonstrate efficacy in the domain of traffic prediction, they are characterised by elevated data requirements and computational costs. Concurrently, pre-trained foundation models, such as the Prior-data Fitted Network (TabPFN), have demonstrated noteworthy performance in general tabular tasks with high efficiency. This juxtaposition gives rise to a critical question: can a general-purpose foundation model, augmented with domain-specific feature engineering, match the performance of specialized architectures in a complex domain such as traffic forecasting? In order to investigate this, an evaluation framework was introduced, known as TabPFN-ST-AR. This is an adaptation of TabPFN that has been designed for traffic prediction using a comprehensive spatio-temporal feature set. A rigorous comparison against a wide range of baselines is conducted on the benchmark METR-LA dataset. The baselines include state-of-the-art STGNNs (Graph WaveNet, DCRNN, STGCN, ASTGCN), traditional machine learning models (XGBoost, CatBoost), and classic deep learning models (LSTM). The findings demonstrate that while top-tier STGNNs such as GraphWaveNet maintain a clear performance advantage, our TabPFN-ST-AR framework is highly competitive, outperforming not only traditional baselines but also some established STGNN models. This outcome serves to emphasise the efficacy of feature engineering, while concurrently providing a quantifiable measurement of the residual performance disparity when compared to contemporary specialist models. It is concluded that, while feature engineering is beneficial, it cannot fully substitute for the architectural inductive biases inherent to models designed for spatio-temporal graph structures. This finding indicates a potential direction for future research, namely the exploration of hybrid modelling and the adaptation of foundation models to specific domains.",10.1145/3768740.3768798,2025,,ACM
An Information Cascade Prediction Algorithm Based on Time Series,"The prediction of information cascades is a crucial task in data mining, which aims to understand the patterns of information diffusion at macroscopic and microscopic levels. The objective of the macro level is to predict the popularity of information cascades in the future. However, the current macro information cascade prediction algorithms produce a fixed popularity prediction value for a specific future time, which lacks flexibility. In this paper, we propose a novel information cascade prediction algorithm, named CasInformer. This algorithm views information cascades as a sequence of cascaded graph snapshots and employs time series prediction to make inferences. CasInformer enhances the selection method of cascaded snapshots and utilizes diverse information to encode supplementary data, which significantly enhances prediction accuracy compared to existing algorithms. CasInformer can predict the cascading popularity at multiple different times to obtain the future trend of information cascading popularity, which is more practical in real scenarios. Experimental results on real datasets show that CasInformer has achieved significant improvement in both prediction accuracy and prediction ability compared to existing research.",10.1145/3696409.3700258,2024,,ACM
Multivariate Time-Series Data Anomaly Detection via Dimension Independence and Reconstruction,"Time-series data anomaly detection has received widespread attention from academia and industry, with crucial applications in service monitor, IoT surveillance, and network security. Existing anomaly detection methods for multivariate time-series data (MTS) typically (1) focus solely on low-accuracy anomalies, neglecting explicit errors, which limits the applicability; (2) treat data dimensionality as a fixed parameter during training and inference, which limits the scalability of trained model to data with varying dimensions. To address these problems, we propose a Transformer framework for MTS anomaly detection based on dimension independence and reconstruction. The framework comprises three components: (1) time-series data preprocessing, (2) MTS reconstruction model, and (3) anomaly detection. Preprocessing step resolves explicit errors and prepares data. MTS reconstruction model built on dimension independence and Transformer encoder, reconstructs each MTS dimension independently. Anomaly detection step identifies low-accuracy anomaly and outputs the final anomaly detection results. Comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms all baseline methods on two real-world datasets and achieves second place on the remaining two datasets. Furthermore, preprocessing and scalability experiments yield highly satisfactory results, validating the completeness and scalability of the framework.",10.1145/3725472.3725475,2025,,ACM
Enhancing Logical Reasoning in Large Language Models via Multi-Stage Ensemble Architecture with Adaptive Attention and Decision Voting,"Increasing difficulty of logical reasoning tasks suggests the deficiency of conventional large language models (LLMs) in solving multi-step reasoning problems. This paper presents a novel multi-stage ensemble method to enhance LLMsQS reasoning capability. The design includes cascading networks, in which dynamic candidates are selected as the inputs and an adaptive self-attention mechanism and voting are applied for decision- making, which together enhance the model's accuracy and robustness. Based on the confidence levels, candidate selection is carried out and the candidates are then refined utilizing multi-head adaptive attention. Then, decision voting fuses reasoning results of several different models, which improves the stability and diversity of the model. Proposed different from state-of-the-art methods, the multi-stage ensemble approach significantly enhances the logic reasoning ability of the model, especially in more complex multi-step problems according to the experimental results. An ablation study validates that the adaptive attention mechanism and ensemble decision method contribute positively to enhancing the model performance. Not only does this out-perform classical models in accuracy, but it also strikes a great balance in reasoning efficiency and model interpretability, thus establishing a new paradigm for AI-based logical reasoning tasks.",10.1145/3724154.3724348,2025,,ACM
GraphSparseNet: A Novel Method for Large Scale Traffic Flow Prediction,"Traffic flow forecasting is a critical spatio-temporal data mining task with wide-ranging applications in intelligent route planning and dynamic traffic management. Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly through Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have significantly enhanced the accuracy of these forecasts by capturing complex spatio-temporal dynamics. However, the scalability of GNNs remains a challenge due to their exponential growth in model complexity with increasing nodes in the graph. Existing methods to address this issue, including sparsification, decomposition, and kernel-based approaches, either do not fully resolve the complexity issue or risk compromising predictive accuracy. This paper introduces GraphSparseNet (GSNet), a novel framework designed to improve both the scalability and accuracy of GNN-based traffic forecasting models. GraphSparseNet is comprised of two core modules: the Feature Extractor and the Relational Compressor. These modules operate with linear time and space complexity, thereby reducing the overall computational complexity of the model to a linear scale. Our extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that GraphSparseNet not only significantly reduces training time by 3.51x compared to state-of-the-art linear models but also maintains high predictive performance.",10.14778/3734839.3734862,2025,,ACM
Towards Spatio-temporal Sea Surface Temperature Forecasting via Dynamic Personalized Graph Network,"Sea surface temperature (SST) is uniquely important to the Earth’s atmosphere since its dynamics are a major force in shaping local and global climate and profoundly affect our ecosystems. Accurate forecasting of SST brings significant economic and social implications, for example, better preparation for extreme weather such as severe droughts or tropical cyclones months ahead. However, such a task faces unique challenges due to the intrinsic complexity and uncertainty of ocean systems. Recently, deep learning techniques, such as graphical neural networks (GNN), have been applied to address this task. While such techniques achieve certain levels of success, they often have significant limitations in exploring dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies between signals. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel graph convolution network architecture with static and dynamic learning layers for SST forecasting. Specifically, two adaptive adjacency matrices are firstly constructed to respectively model the stable long-term and short-term evolutionary patterns hidden in the multivariate SST signals. Then, a personalized convolution layer is designed to fuse these information. The developed network can be learned in an end-to-end manner.

Transformer-Based Risk Monitoring for Anti-Money Laundering with Transaction Graph Integration,"This study addresses the growing complexity of transaction behaviors and the highly concealed nature of money laundering paths in current financial AML scenarios. It proposes a Transformer-based risk monitoring model for anti-money laundering. The approach is grounded in transaction sequence modeling and integrates the structural information of transaction graphs. A context-aware classifier is introduced to enable accurate identification and risk scoring of high-risk accounts. The model first applies feature embedding and positional encoding to each transaction. It then uses multiple Transformer layers to capture long-range behavioral dependencies. At the same time, it incorporates account interaction information from the graph structure. This enhances the model's ability to detect abnormal transaction chains across accounts. At the output stage, a classifier that fuses sequential semantics with graph context is used to determine the overall money laundering risk of each account. Multiple experiments were conducted on the publicly available Elliptic dataset. Results show that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream models on evaluation metrics such as AUC, F1-Score, and Accuracy. It also demonstrates stronger discriminative power and greater stability in identifying high-risk accounts. Further analysis of model depth sensitivity and case-based verification supports the model's effectiveness in real-world complex transaction environments.

ST-FLAM: Evaluating Performance of Deep Learning Models on Mobility Patterns for EVD Forecasting based on Spatio-Temporal Feature Learning,"Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) is a highly contagious and fatal disease that poses a serious threat to public health and security. Accurate and timely forecasting of EVD outbreaks is essential for effective prevention and control measures. However, traditional epidemiological models often fail to capture the complex and dynamic nature of human mobility, which plays a key role in EVD transmission. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for EVD forecasting based on spatio-temporal feature learning called ST-FLAM. We use various types of mobility data, such as phone records, Global Positioning System (GPS) traces, and social media posts, to extract meaningful and representative features that reflect the mobility patterns of individuals and populations. Next, we employ ST-FLAM architectures, which incorporate Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), to establish connections and dependencies between mobility features and EVD cases in both space and time. We evaluate the performance of our framework on real-world datasets from the 2014–2016 West Africa EVD outbreak and the 2015–2016 EVD and human mobility in Sierra Leone. We compare our framework with baseline methods to handle traditional epidemiological challenges during an outbreak. We conduct ablation studies and analyse the impact of different mobility data sources, feature extraction methods, and deep learning architectures on EVD forecasting accuracy. Our results show that our framework outperforms the baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance in EVD forecasting. We also demonstrate that our framework can provide interpretable and actionable insights for EVD prevention and control.",10.1145/3711650.3711665,2025,,ACM

DiffSTG: Probabilistic Spatio-Temporal Graph Forecasting  with Denoising Diffusion Models,"Spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNN) have emerged as the dominant model for spatio-temporal graph (STG) forecasting. Despite their success, they fail to model intrinsic uncertainties within STG data, which cripples their practicality in downstream tasks for decision-making. To this end, this paper focuses on probabilistic STG forecasting, which is challenging due to the difficulty in modeling uncertainties and complex ST dependencies. In this study, we present the first attempt to generalize the popular de-noising diffusion probabilistic models to STGs, leading to a novel non-autoregressive framework called DiffSTG, along with the first denoising network UGnet for STG in the framework. Our approach combines the spatio-temporal learning capabilities of STGNNs with the uncertainty measurements of diffusion models. Extensive experiments validate that DiffSTG reduces the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) by 4\%-14\%, and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) by 2\%-7\% over existing methods on three real-world datasets.",10.1145/3589132.3625614,2023,,ACM
ASTGCL: Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph-enhanced Contrastive Learning for Traffic Flow Prediction,"With the rise of intelligent urban systems, traffic flow prediction has emerged as a vital element within intelligent transportation frameworks. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are crucial for traffic flow prediction due to the non-Euclidean nature of traffic networks. Most GNN-based approaches depend on predefined adjacency matrices, frequently failing to model complex global dependencies. Additionally, these methods primarily use supervised learning, which is highly dependent on data quality. However, traffic data often suffers from missing values caused by sensor malfunctions, hindering effective feature extraction. To overcome these limitations, a novel framework called Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph-enhanced Contrastive Learning for Traffic Flow Prediction (ASTGCL) is introduced to improve prediction performance. Specifically, ASTGCL implements two data augmentation strategies: first, it employs an adaptive, learnable adjacency matrix to enhance the predefined matrix, enabling the model to capture both local and global topological features; second, it integrates three traffic data augmentation techniques to reduce the influence of data noise on prediction accuracy. The enhanced adjacency matrix and augmented traffic data are then utilized in a spatio-temporal contrastive learning process to extract higher-order spatio-temporal features from the traffic flow data. Experiments conducted on four real-world datasets reveal that ASTGCL surpasses baseline models, confirming the efficacy of the proposed framework.",10.1145/3746709.3746760,2025,,ACM
GNN Graph Classification for Time Series: A New Perspective on Climate Change Analysis,"The use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in time series analysis represents a rising field of study, particularly in the context of GNN Graph Classification, a technique traditionally applied in disciplines such as biology and chemistry. Our research repurposes GNN Graph Classification for the analysis of time series for climate data, focusing on two distinct methodologies: the city-graph method, which effectively captures static temporal snapshots, and the sliding window graph method, adept at tracking dynamic temporal changes. This innovative application of GNN Graph Classification within time series data enables the uncovering of nuanced data trends. We demonstrate how GNNs can construct meaningful graphs from time series data, showcasing their versatility across different analytical contexts. A key finding is GNNs’ adeptness at adapting to changes in graph structure, which significantly improves outlier detection. This enhances our understanding of climate patterns and suggests broader applications of GNN Graph Classification in analyzing complex data systems beyond traditional time series analysis. Our research seeks to fill a gap in current studies by providing an examination of GNNs in climate change analysis, highlighting the potential of these methods in capturing and interpreting intricate data trends.",10.1145/3674029.3674059,2024,,ACM
Multi-scale Traffic Pattern Bank for Cross-city Few-shot Traffic Forecasting,"Traffic forecasting is crucial for intelligent transportation systems (ITS), aiding in efficient resource allocation and effective traffic control. However, its effectiveness often relies heavily on abundant traffic data, while many cities lack sufficient data due to limited device support, posing a significant challenge for traffic forecasting. Recognizing this challenge, we have made a noteworthy observation: traffic patterns exhibit similarities across diverse cities. Building on this key insight, we propose a solution for the cross-city few-shot traffic forecasting problem called Multi-scale Traffic Pattern Bank (MTPB). Primarily, MTPB initiates its learning process by leveraging data-rich source cities, effectively acquiring comprehensive traffic knowledge through a spatial-temporal-aware pre-training process. Subsequently, the framework employs advanced clustering techniques to systematically generate a multi-scale traffic pattern bank derived from the learned knowledge. Next, the traffic data of the data-scarce target city could query the traffic pattern bank, facilitating the aggregation of meta-knowledge. This meta-knowledge, in turn, assumes a pivotal role as a robust guide in subsequent processes involving graph reconstruction and forecasting. Empirical assessments conducted on real-world traffic datasets affirm the superior performance of MTPB, surpassing existing methods across various categories and exhibiting numerous attributes conducive to the advancement of cross-city few-shot forecasting methodologies. The code is available in .",10.1145/3727622,2025,,ACM

Context-driven Deep Learning Forecasting for Wastewater Treatment Plants,"Wastewater‑treatment utilities face various operational challenges that could benefit from embodied AI and other advanced cyber‑physical technologies. These challenges include optimizing pump schedules, managing energy and chemical consumption during extreme weather events, and interpreting sensor data for water‑quality treatment. Addressing these issues requires accurate short‑term, multi‑step forecasting tools to provide reliable real‑time decision support, particularly during heavy‑rainfall events that can overwhelm operations. Leading water‑system operators and vendors in the United States report that tools capable of forecasting 4–6 hours ahead can significantly enhance resource management, including energy, chemicals, and manpower. However, accurate short‑term forecasting is particularly difficult because of the non‑linearities and seasonal variations inherent in plant data, which limit effective decision‑making. To address these challenges, we propose cP2O, a context‑driven forecasting solution, a novel hybrid deep‑learning architecture integrating dynamic context extraction with hierarchical, dilated long‑short‑term‑memory (LSTM) cells. The proposed model utilizes internal water‑system data, such as flow rates and tunnel levels, along with exogenous variables including weather, river flow, and demographic information to derive relevant context. It captures both short‑term fluctuations and long‑term dependencies in water‑level data, while an internal attention mechanism dynamically weighs the importance of exogenous information. We validate the model on two full‑scale utilities: tunnel‑water‑level forecasting at DC Water’s Blue Plains facility and nitrate‑level prediction at AlexRenew. Relative to strong baselines, cP2O reduces mean absolute percentage error by 22 \% and 19 \%, respectively, and its 90 \% prediction bands cover 90.5 \% ± 3.2 \% of observations (5.9 \% below, 3.6 \% above). By dynamically incorporating contextual information, especially under critical conditions, the model delivers reliable real‑time forecasts that enhance resource allocation and strengthen the overall resilience of wastewater‑treatment operations.",10.1145/3744350,2025,,ACM
Spatio-Temporal Transformer Network with Physical Knowledge Distillation for Weather Forecasting,"Weather forecasting has become a popular research topic recently, which mainly benefits from the development of spatio-temporal neural networks to effectively extract useful patterns from weather data. Generally, the weather changes in the meteorological system are governed by physical principles. However, it is challenging for spatio-temporal methods to capture the physical knowledge of meteorological dynamics. To address this problem, we propose in this paper a spatio-temporal Transformer network with physical knowledge distillation (PKD-STTN) for weather forecasting. First, the teacher network is implemented by a differential equation network that models weather changes by the potential energy in the atmosphere to reveal the physical mechanism of atmospheric movements. Second, the student network uses a spatio-temporal Transformer that concurrently utilizes three attention modules to comprehensively capture the semantic spatial correlation, geographical spatial correlation, and temporal correlation from weather data. Finally, the physical knowledge of the teacher network is transferred to the student network by inserting a distillation position encoding into the Transformer. Notice that the output of the teacher network is distilled to the position encoding rather than the output of the student network, which can largely utilize physical knowledge without influencing the feature extraction process of Transformers. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method can effectively utilize physical principles of weather changes and has obvious performance advantages compared with several strong baselines.",10.1145/3627673.3679841,2024,,ACM
Enhancing Transformer Models for Long-Term Time Series Classification with Multi-Channel Frequency-Domain Filters,"Time-series classification plays a critical role in numerous domains such as healthcare, activity recognition, and industrial monitoring. Traditional Transformer models, while effective in modeling long-range dependencies, tend to focus disproportionately on high-energy frequency components, potentially overlooking valuable low-frequency information. To address this issue, we propose a frequency-domain filter Transformer model that incorporates a multi-channel frequency decomposition module prior to the Transformer encoder. This module applies parallel frequency-specific filters to segment the input sequence into distinct bands, enabling the model to extract features from both high- and low-frequency components. Each frequency stream is processed by a dedicated Transformer branch, and the results are aggregated to form a comprehensive representation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets such as KU-HAR demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms baseline methods, including CNN, CNN-LSTM, and Transformer architectures, achieving superior accuracy and robustness. The proposed approach effectively mitigates the attention bias toward single-band information and enhances the interpretability and performance of Transformer-based time-series classifiers.",10.1145/3760658.3760677,2025,,ACM
Towards Predicting Urban Land Use Changes: A Dynamic Graph Alignment Perspective,"Urban land use, intrinsically linked to people’s daily activities, undergoes continuous evolution, presenting a complex interplay that remains partially understood. To bridge this gap, our study leverages fine-grained human mobility data to predict these changes, adopting a novel approach that conceptualizes “community-level” land use shifts as a regression problem and represents citywide changes through dynamic graphs. We harness recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs), which, despite their success in various applications, face challenges in directly predicting land use changes due to the temporal mismatch between the slow evolution of urban land and the immediacy of human mobility data. Our research stands out by introducing a temporal skeleton for dynamic GNNs to synchronize human activity graphs with urban land use changes, a dynamic heterogeneous GNN approach for integrating diverse human activity data to capture essential temporal dependencies, and a novel algorithm powered by causal inference to elucidate the primary factors influencing land use predictions at the community level, all of which contribute to a training process informed by the generated causal graph. Empirically validated on three real-world datasets, our model demonstrates a performance leap over state-of-the-art baselines, marking a pivotal step toward understanding and predicting the dynamics of urban land use.",10.1145/3712702,2025,,ACM
Automobile sales forecasting based on Special Zero-inflated Data,"Car sales projections are important for manufacturers in terms of production adjustments and strategic planning. Traditionally, such predictions tend to focus only on brand performance across a wide range of markets. The LSTM model showed good prediction results. Due to the increasing importance of Market Segmentation, the demand for some car sales forecasts (PAS) has increased, and PAS data contains a large number of zero values and has significant cyclicality. This creates problems with traditional statistical methods and becomes difficult to capture the nuances of the data. To solve this problem, a method is proposed that combines short-and long-term memory (LSTM) networks and zero-expansion Poisson models. The latter is suitable for processing data with superfluous zero values and complex patterns. The mixed-loss zero-expansion LSTM system (Zim-LSTM) has also been implemented to improve robust and long-term forecasting capabilities for future pa. Zim-LSTM has advantages in modeling common zero values and stores historical information to facilitate the short-sighted task of predicting time series. Using a method of verifying sales data of real cars and comparing them with existing reference models, the results show that the accuracy and reliability of Zim-LSTM have improved, making it a promising solution for predicting PAS..",10.1145/3745533.3745595,2025,,ACM
Photovoltaic Power Output Prediction Based on Simple Weather Data and Graph Convolutional Networks,"Graph neural networks, as a class of models capable of handling graph-structured data, have been widely applied and researched in various fields in recent years. In the power industry, photovoltaic power output prediction is an important topic, and the relative positions of photovoltaic power stations, as a form of unstructured information, provide an opportunity for the application of graph neural networks. In this context, we utilize multiple layers of graph convolutional layers to construct the network, stack the graph convolutional layer with the normalization layer and connect two fully connected layers at the end. Regarding the dataset, existing algorithms may face challenges such as difficulty in acquisition and lack of sufficient data support. To address this, we use simple weather data as input variables, simultaneously construct regression models for meteorological indicators, and employ the variance inflation factor to remove highly similar nodes, aiming to reduce the complexity of the graph. The specific operation is to set the threshold, establish a regression model between each meteorological indicator of each node and the meteorological indicators of other nodes, and calculate the variance inflation factor. Filter the removable nodes according to the variance inflation factor, randomly remove a node and refit the regression. model, by iterating until the remaining nodes are not highly relevant. Experimental validation shows that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of accuracy.",10.1145/3662739.3672175,2024,,ACM
Leveraging LLMs for Semantic Correlation Enhancement in Spatial-temporal Imputation,"Spatial-temporal imputation remains a challenging problem in transportation, environment and healthcare, where the missing value is filled based on spatial, temporal, and cross correlations. Previous research mainly focused on feature-level correlation integration and comprehension with the hand-crafted enhancement strategy. Meanwhile, the recently prevalent large language models (LLMs) provide token-level understanding for language linguistics, and whether they could be applied for spatial-temporal correlation enhancement is under exploration. To this end, we proposed an LLM-native framework STOMA to fully utilize the intrinsic relevance. We designed semantic enhancing methods by converting the complex correlations, e.g. spatial correlation in network, temporal correlation with periodicity and cross correlation from human behavior, into the embedded tokens. Specifically, we reform dynamic time warping as an asymmetric correlation constructor for complex dynamics. We adapt the proposed backbone along with the spatial-temporal fine-tuning technique, and the empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods over recent LLM-inspired methods evaluating on real-world datasets.",10.1145/3776557,2025,,ACM
Transportation Flow Prediction Based on Graph Attention Echo State Network,"Abstract—Traffic flow prediction is of great importance in applications such as traffic management and urban planning. The complex spatial and temporal dependence of traffic flow between different roads poses a great challenge for accurate real-time traffic flow prediction. Traditional traffic flow prediction methods rely on the assumption of data smoothness, and the prediction accuracy decreases significantly in the face of complex, variable and large amount of traffic flow data. Spatio-temporal prediction models based on graph neural networks and recurrent neural networks can achieve better prediction accuracy, but there are still some problems, such as the need for a known static graph structure, inadequate spatial extraction and long training time of the model. To improve traffic flow prediction accuracy and real-time performance, this paper proposes a novel end-to-end deep learning framework called graph attention echo state network (GAESN), which uses attention mechanism and echo state network to extract spatio-temporal features. Experimental results on four real traffic flow datasets show that our proposed model achieves 17.35, 21.34, 24.12 and 17.31 in mean absolute error(MAE); 29.31, 32.67, 37.51and 26.84 in root mean square error(RMSE); 16.76\%, 15.44\%, 10.33\% and 10.94\% in mean absolute percentage error(MAPE), respectively. Compared with other existing models, this model reduces the number of parameters to be trained and the time required for model training, and also improves the accuracy of traffic flow prediction.",10.1145/3603781.3603907,2023,,ACM

Physics-Informed vs. Deep Learning: Indoor Temperature Prediction with Different Data Availability,"Reducing energy consumption in the building sector is crucial for global sustainability. Achieving energy efficiency requires advanced technologies and robust building models that address uncertainties and environmental variations. White-box models, based on physical principles, provide interpretability but require significant expertise and resources. In contrast, black-box models rely on historical data, lacking interpretability and being dataset-dependent. To bridge this gap, Scientific Machine Learning integrates physical insights into machine learning frameworks, ensuring interpretability while maintaining the accuracy and computational efficiency of models like neural networks. This work incorporates physical knowledge through Ordinary Differential Equations into the neural network framework, developing a physics-informed model to predict indoor air temperature based on external conditions, system thermal powers, and building internal gains. Datasets from four cities with diverse climatic conditions were used, and the model was trained on varying amounts of data, from two weeks to two years. This approach offers a novel exploration of model performance under different data availability and multiple scenarios. A comparative analysis with a Long Short-Term Memory neural network shows that, especially with limited training data, the Physics-Informed Neural Network outperforms the conventional model, with a Mean Absolute Error up to 0.69°C lower. This advantage is due to the incorporation of physics-based constraints, reducing reliance on large datasets. Additionally, the Physics-Informed Neural Network demonstrates stable accuracy across seasonal and uncontrolled dynamics conditions, highlighting its potential for temperature prediction and building control applications.",10.1145/3679240.3734642,2025,,ACM
Tide: A Time-Wise Causal Debiasing Framework for Generative Dynamic Link Prediction,"Dynamic link prediction aims to predict the future links in dynamic graphs. Existing generative dynamic link prediction studies utilize the global degree distribution for mitigating the over-estimation problem, which can model the time-invariant features while neglecting the time-varying features, resulting in capturing inaccurate evolution patterns. However, such time related features are intrinsically coupled, which makes simultaneously and independently modeling both features infeasible. Motivated by these issues, we propose a Time-wise causal debiasing framework (Tide) for generative dynamic link prediction, which does not resort to any extra trainable modules. Instead, to obtain the time-invariant features, we first utilize a time-invariant deconfounded learning mechanism for decoupling the prediction score with the degree distribution. To leverage the time-varying features, we intervene in the model during the inference stage by a predicted future degree distribution, aiming to make the accurate predictions for dynamic graphs. Experiments conducted on four public datasets under both inductive and transductive settings present that our Tide enhanced models can outperform their corresponding vanilla versions by up to 21.42\% and 27.73\% in terms of NDCG and Jaccard, respectively.",10.1145/3746252.3761182,2025,,ACM
LLM4DyG: Can Large Language Models Solve Spatial-Temporal Problems on Dynamic Graphs?,"In an era marked by the increasing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) for various tasks, there is a growing focus on exploring LLMs' capabilities in handling web data, particularly graph data. Dynamic graphs, which capture temporal network evolution patterns, are ubiquitous in real-world web data. Evaluating LLMs' competence in understanding spatial-temporal information on dynamic graphs is essential for their adoption in web applications, which remains unexplored in the literature. In this paper, we bridge the gap via proposing to evaluate LLMs' spatial-temporal understanding abilities on dynamic graphs, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time. Specifically, we propose the LLM4DyG benchmark, which includes nine specially designed tasks considering the capability evaluation of LLMs from both temporal and spatial dimensions. Then, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze the impacts of different data generators, data statistics, prompting techniques, and LLMs on the model performance. Finally, we propose Disentangled Spatial-Temporal Thoughts (DST2) for LLMs on dynamic graphs to enhance LLMs' spatial-temporal understanding abilities. Our main observations are: 1) LLMs have preliminary spatial-temporal understanding abilities on dynamic graphs, 2) Dynamic graph tasks show increasing difficulties for LLMs as the graph size and density increase, while not sensitive to the time span and data generation mechanism, 3) the proposed DST2 prompting method can help to improve LLMs' spatial-temporal understanding abilities on dynamic graphs for most tasks.

Exploring The Efficient Market Hypothesis for Accurate Stock Movement Prediction via Feature-Axis Transformer,"Stock movement forecasting is a significant challenge in financial machine-learning application fields due to its profound impact on financial markets. While the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) [10] postulates that predicting stock movement is nearly impossible, recent studies using deep learning methodologies exhibit promising results. The EMH is based on the assumption that stock prices immediately incorporate all available information, such as financial statements, earnings announcements, and macroeconomic news. Input features used by the prior studies commonly include Open, High, Low, Close, and Adjusted Close (OHLCA), which potentially contain salient information for forecasting movements. However, most have yet to extract the information implicit in each price separately and utilize it to make predictions. This paper proposes FATE: Feature-Axis Transformer based on EMH designed to leverage each OHLCA component to facilitate stock movement prediction. FATE consists of three modules: 1) capturing each feature's temporal correlation between various stocks; 2) generating global market context data; and 3) constructing a contextual vector through correlating to other prices around the closing price. Experimental results show that FATE demonstrates better predictive results than state-of-the-art baselines on six real-world datasets. FATE also yields profitable portfolio trading gains compared to the baselines. Furthermore, it offers interpretable visualized results during its stock movement forecasting operations.",10.1145/3605098.3635928,2024,,ACM
"Graph Learning-based Fleet Scheduling for Urban Air Mobility under Operational Constraints, Varying Demand \&amp; Uncertainties","This paper develops a graph reinforcement learning approach to online planning of the schedule and destinations of electric aircraft that comprise an urban air mobility (UAM) fleet operating across multiple vertiports. This fleet scheduling problem is formulated to consider time-varying demand, constraints related to vertiport capacity, aircraft capacity and airspace safety guidelines, uncertainties related to take-off delay, weather-induced route closures, and unanticipated aircraft downtime. Collectively, such a formulation presents greater complexity, and potentially increased realism, than in existing UAM fleet planning implementations. To address these complexities, a new policy architecture is constructed, primary components of which include: graph capsule conv-nets for encoding vertiport and aircraft-fleet states both abstracted as graphs; transformer layers encoding time series information on demand and passenger fare; and a Multi-head Attention-based decoder that uses the encoded information to compute the probability of selecting each available destination for an aircraft. Trained with Proximal Policy Optimization, this policy architecture shows significantly better performance in terms of daily averaged profits on unseen test scenarios involving 8 vertiports and 40 aircraft, when compared to a random baseline and genetic algorithm-derived optimal solutions, while being nearly 1000 times faster in execution than the latter.",10.1145/3605098.3635976,2024,,ACM
Navigating Out-of-Distribution Electricity Load Forecasting during COVID-19: Benchmarking energy load forecasting models without and with continual learning,"In traditional deep learning algorithms, one of the key assumptions is that the data distribution remains constant during both training and deployment. However, this assumption becomes problematic when faced with Out-of-Distribution periods, such as the COVID-19 lockdowns, where the data distribution significantly deviates from what the model has seen during training. This paper employs a two-fold strategy: utilizing continual learning techniques to update models with new data and harnessing human mobility data collected from privacy-preserving pedestrian counters located outside buildings. In contrast to online learning, which suffers from ’catastrophic forgetting’ as newly acquired knowledge often erases prior information, continual learning offers a holistic approach by preserving past insights while integrating new data. This research applies FSNet, a powerful continual learning algorithm, to real-world data from 13 building complexes in Melbourne, Australia, a city which had the second longest total lockdown duration globally during the pandemic. Results underscore the crucial role of continual learning in accurate energy forecasting, particularly during Out-of-Distribution periods. Secondary data such as mobility and temperature provided ancillary support to the primary forecasting model. More importantly, while traditional methods struggled to adapt during lockdowns, models featuring at least online learning demonstrated resilience, with lockdown periods posing fewer challenges once armed with adaptive learning techniques. This study contributes valuable methodologies and insights to the ongoing effort to improve energy load forecasting during future Out-of-Distribution periods.",10.1145/3600100.3623726,2023,,ACM
Enhancing Spatial-Temporal Prediction Models with Dynamic Causal Graphs,"Spatial-temporal prediction has become an important task in many applications, such as traffic forecasting. Due to the spatial-temporal nature of data, most state-of-the-art methods heavily depend on graph neural networks to model the inherent spatial relationships. However, most of them process the spatial data by applying the prior adjacency knowledge or learning a static adaptive adjacency matrix. Thus, their prediction performance is limited on dynamic situations where the spatial dependencies change w.r.t time. Furthermore, considering the stochastic training process, learning an adaptive adjacency matrix from scratch also makes it difficult for the neural network to achieve stable parameters and performance. To address the above challenges, this paper proposes three practical extensions that incorporate dynamic causal knowledge into the training of graph convolution networks. We first analyze the dynamic causal graphs between traffic nodes with one dynamic causal discovery algorithm in each extended model. Subsequently, the spatial module employs dynamic causal graphs to reveal the evolving connections among nodes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method has successfully enhanced state-of-the-art traffic forecasting models on two benchmarks.",10.1145/3777547,2025,,ACM
A Clustering-based Multi-Task Learning Method using Graph Attention Network for Short-term Traffic Forecasting,"In modern intelligent transportation systems, accurate short-term traffic forecasting is pivotal for managers and travelers. While recent spatio-temporal traffic forecasting models excel in short-term predictions, data from different traffic node inherently possesses diverse characteristics, yet existing models tend to neglect the disparities between these nodes and treat neighboring nodes with different data in a uniform manner, overlooking their unique attributes, which can result in imprecise prediction results. To address these concerns, this paper introduces, the Clustering-based Multi-Task Learning Method using Graph Attention Network (CMTGAT). This model adopts a multi-task learning framework, enhanced with time-series clustering for nuanced pattern recognition and improved prediction accuracy in diverse traffic scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the CMTGAT model outperforms existing methods, almost doubling in forecasting precision. The integration of the time series clustering and the graph attention mechanism helps to reduce the MAPE approximately by 6\%.",10.1145/3669754.3669825,2024,,ACM

Research and Application of Edge Cloud Load Prediction Based on DR-STGNN?,"Cloud servers generate a large amount of monitoring data in real-time, which is often composed of multiple time series monitoring indicators. Accurately predicting cloud load data is significant for capacity forecasting and reasonable resource allocation of cloud platforms. Multidimensional cloud load data has the characteristics of an extended period, low information density, and complex calling relationships between indicators. However, most current time series prediction algorithms perform poorly in cloud load prediction, the specific manifestation lies in the inadequate handling of cloud workload data with long-term dependencies, as well as situations involving multidimensional metrics with complex invocation relationships. This paper proposes the DR-STGNN algorithm for cloud load prediction scenarios. We designed temporal module and spatial module separately to address the challenges of long-term dependency relationships between historical and future data and complex calling relationships between indicators. A bidirectional residual structure was used to connect the modules to avoid the influence of gradient disappearance. We verified the model using the GWA-T-12 rnd trace dataset provided by Bitbrains and compared it with models such as informer, MTGNN, stemGNN, reformer, and TPA-LSTM. MAE and RMSE were used as evaluation indicators, and the results showed that DR-STGNN performed outstandingly in cloud load prediction.",10.1145/3627915.3628025,2023,,ACM
MSTEM: Masked Spatiotemporal Event Series Modeling for Urban Undisciplined Events Forecasting,"Urban undisciplined events (UUE) are of increasing concern to urban officials because they reduce the quality of life and cause societal disorder. How to accurately predict future occurrences is a key point in preventing these events. However, existing supervised methods struggle to perform well on sparse UUEs while self-supervised MAE-based methods adopt a traditional random masking strategy which leads to limited performance on UUE forecasting. Fortunately, we have designed an innovative spatiotemporal masking strategy and its corresponding pre-training task called &lt;u&gt;M&lt;/u&gt;asked &lt;u&gt;S&lt;/u&gt;patio-&lt;u&gt;T&lt;/u&gt;emporal &lt;u&gt;E&lt;/u&gt;vent Series &lt;u&gt;M&lt;/u&gt;odeling (MSTEM). Through Cluster-assisted region masking, MSTEM efficiently distributes masked regions evenly among different clusters, enhancing the model's ability to capture spatial correlation and heterogeneity while addressing sparse region distribution of UUEs. Frequency-enhanced patch masking helps the model to sufficiently extract the temporal features of UUEs by reconstructing multiple views. Additionally, we propose future merge and cluster label modeling to enhance the extraction of spatiotemporal dependencies, thereby improving the performance of MSTEM on downstream prediction tasks. Experimental evaluations on four real-world datasets including crimes and disorderly conduct show that our masked autoencoder with MSTEM outperforms most of the state-of-the-art baselines.",10.1145/3627673.3679810,2024,,ACM
Irregularity-Informed Time Series Analysis: Adaptive Modelling of Spatial and Temporal Dynamics,"Irregular Time Series Data (IRTS) has shown increasing prevalence in real-world applications. We observed that IRTS can be divided into two specialized types: Natural Irregular Time Series (NIRTS) and Accidental Irregular Time Series (AIRTS). Various existing methods either ignore the impacts of irregular patterns or statically learn the irregular dynamics of NIRTS and AIRTS data and suffer from limited data availability due to the sparsity of IRTS. We proposed a novel transformer-based framework for general irregular time series data that treats IRTS from four views: Locality, Time, Spatio and Irregularity to motivate the data usage to the highest potential. Moreover, we design a sophisticated irregularity-gate mechanism to adaptively select task-relevant information from irregularity, which improves the generalization ability to various IRTS data. We implement extensive experiments to demonstrate the resistance of our work to three highly missing ratio datasets (88.4\%, 94.9\%, 60\% missing value) and investigate the significance of the irregularity information for both NIRTS and AIRTS by additional ablation study. We release our implementation in https://github.com/IcurasLW/MTSFormer-Irregular_Time_Series.git.",10.1145/3627673.3679716,2024,,ACM
Explainable Stock Price Movement Prediction using Contrastive Learning,"Predicting stock price movements is a high-stakes task that demands explainability for human decision-makers.

Multi-Hop Multi-View Memory Transformer for Session-Based Recommendation,"A Session-Based Recommendation (SBR) seeks to predict users’ future item preferences by analyzing their interactions with previously clicked items. In recent approaches, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been commonly applied to capture item relations within a session to infer user intentions. However, these GNN-based methods typically struggle with feature ambiguity between the sequential session information and the item conversion within an item graph, which may impede the model’s ability to accurately infer user intentions. In this article, we propose a novel Multi-hop Multi-view Memory Transformer (M3T) to effectively integrate the sequence-view information and relation conversion (graph-view information) of items in a session. First, we propose a Multi-view Memory Transformer (M2T) module to concurrently obtain multi-view information of items. Then, a set of trainable memory matrices are employed to store sharable item features, which mitigates cross-view item feature ambiguity. To comprehensively capture latent user intentions, an M3T framework is designed to integrate user intentions across different hops of an item graph. Specifically, a k-order power method is proposed to manage the item graph to alleviate the over-smoothing problem when obtaining high-order relations of items. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.",10.1145/3663760,2024,,ACM
TempASD: Temporal Anomalous Subgraph Discovery in Large-Scale Dynamic Financial Networks,"In this paper, we investigate the discovery of temporal anomalous subgraphs in large-scale financial networks, aiming to identify abnormal transaction behaviors among users over time. This task is crucial for the real-time detection of transaction anomalies in financial networks, such as money laundering and trading fraud. However, it poses significant challenges due to the diverse distribution of transactions, the dynamic nature of temporal networks, and the absence of theoretical foundation. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel Temporal Anomalous Subgraph Discovery (TempASD) algorithm with theoretical analysis. First, we propose a temporal candidate detection module that quickly pinpoints abnormal candidates by detecting anomalies in both the temporal structure and transaction distribution. Then, we introduce a carefully crafted reinforcement-learning-based refiner to optimize these candidates toward the most abnormal directions. We conducted extensive evaluations against thirteen advanced competitors. TempASD achieves an average improvement of 7x in abnormal degree compared to the state-of-the-art and is efficient in large-scale dynamic financial networks.",10.1145/3711896.3737149,2025,,ACM
Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Graph Learning Based on Metapath Aggregation for Emergency Supply Forecasting,"Integrated Warehousing and Distribution Supply Networks (IWDSN) have shown their high efficiency in E-commerce. Efficient supply capacity prediction is crucial for logistics systems to maintain the delivery capacity to meet users' requirements. However, unforeseen events such as extreme weather and public health emergencies pose challenges in supply forecasting. Previous work mainly infers supply optimization based on the invariant topology of logistic networks, neglecting dynamic routing and distinct node effects reacting to emergencies. To address these challenges, the hierarchical relations among warehouses, sorting centers, and delivery stations in logistic networks are necessary to learn the diverse reactions. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical spatio-temporal graph learning model to predict the emergency supply capacity of IWDSN based on micro and macro graphs. The micro graph shows transportation connectivity while the macro graph shows the geographical correlation. Specifically, it consists of three components. (1) For micro graphs, a metapath aggregation strategy is designed to capture dynamic routing information on both route-view and event-view graphs. (2) For macro graphs, a bipartite graph learning approach to extract spatial representations. (3) For spatio-temporal feature fusion, the spatio-temporal joint forecasting module combines the temporal feature from the time-series encoder with hierarchical spatial features to predict the future supply capacity. The extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model, which achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with advanced baselines.",10.1145/3627673.3679854,2024,,ACM
FEST: A Multi-way Framework with Enhanced Spatial-Temporal Modeling for Traffic Forecasting,"Accurately forecasting traffic flow using time-series data from multimedia sensors remains a significant challenge, despite its importance for advancing intelligent transportation systems. Recent advancements in attention-based models have shown promise in capturing spatial-temporal dependencies in traffic flow data. Yet, these models exhibit three principal limitations: (1) they employ either factorized or coupled spatial-temporal attention mechanisms, potentially failing to fully harness the potential of these distinct approaches; (2) the attention allocation for spatial nodes is predominantly data-centric, which may overlook existing knowledge about the nodes' importance within the transportation network; (3) while traditional attention-based methods effectively capture long-term dependencies, they often struggle with adapting to the disparate lengths of temporal contexts. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a multi-way framework dubbed FEST that innovatively integrates both factorized and coupled spatial-temporal attention mechanisms. We then enhance FEST by incorporating PageRank-derived node importance scores to guide focus on nodes. Moreover, a novel multi-scale temporal learning approach is proposed to improve model capability with both long- and short-term temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets under long- and short-term prediction scenarios confirm the effectiveness of our method.",10.1145/3652583.3658111,2024,,ACM
SUSTeR: Sparse Unstructured Spatio Temporal Reconstruction on Traffic Prediction,"Mining spatio-temporal correlation patterns for traffic prediction is a well-studied field. However, most approaches are based on the assumption of the availability of and accessibility to a sufficiently dense data source, which is rather the rare case in reality. Traffic sensors in road networks are generally highly sparse in their distribution: fleet-based traffic sensing is sparse in space but also sparse in time. There are also other traffic application, besides road traffic, like moving objects in the marine space, where observations are sparsely and arbitrarily distributed in space. In this paper, we tackle the problem of traffic prediction on sparse and spatially irregular and non-deterministic traffic observations. We draw a border between imputations and this work as we consider high sparsity rates and no fixed sensor locations. We advance correlation mining methods with a Sparse Unstructured Spatio Temporal Reconstruction (SUSTeR) framework that reconstructs traffic states from sparse non-stationary observations. For the prediction the framework creates a hidden context traffic state which is enriched in a residual fashion with each observation. Such an assimilated hidden traffic state can be used by existing traffic prediction methods to predict future traffic states. We query these states with query locations from the spatial domain.",10.1145/3589132.3625631,2023,,ACM
Dynamic Routing Method for Integrated Satellite–Terrestrial Multi-Domain Networks Based on Transfer Learning,"With the development of communication technology and the diversification of users' needs, the space-earth integrated multi-domain network has become the core of modern communication system. However, rapidly changing topologies, frequent satellite switching, and heterogeneous traffic conditions can challenge classical deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, affecting real-time accuracy and robust convergence. Given that these networks continue to evolve, rapid adaptation is critical to maintaining data throughput and a seamless user experience. To solve these problems, this paper introduces STGT (Space-Ground Generative Transport), a novel dynamic routing framework that combines generative adversarial network (GAN) with near-end Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm.STGT uses transfer learning to leverage the knowledge of previously trained models, reducing the training overhead under changing topological conditions. It can achieve stable convergence in the case of constant link fluctuation. Numerous experiments have shown that STGT outperforms leading DRL-based approaches, including PPO, DQN, SAP, and ospf, in terms of convergence speed, robustness, and flexibility. Notably, under the same constellation observed at different times, the STGT trained 5.7 times faster than the baseline PPO. As a result, STGT strikes a critical balance between adaptive speed and decision accuracy, resulting in stable, high-performance routing across a range of real-time conditions. These findings demonstrate that combining GAN and PPO through transfer learning effectively addresses dynamic routing challenges in satellite-ground integrated multi-domain networks, providing an efficient and scalable solution for real-world deployment.",10.1145/3732945.3732978,2025,,ACM
Deep Learning techniques for stock market forecasting: Recent trends and challenges,"Stock market forecasting has been a very intensive area of research in recent years due to the highly uncertain and volatile nature of stock data which makes this task challenging. By accurately predicting a particular stock's price investors can gain maximum profit out of their investment. With the great success of Deep Learning methods in various domains, it has attracted the research community to apply these models for financial domain also. These DL methods have been proven to achieve better accuracy and predictions compared to econometric and traditional ML methods. This work reviews recent papers according to various Deep Learning models which included: Artificial Neural Networks, Convolution Neural Networks, Sequence to Sequence models, Generative Adversarial Networks, Graph Neural Networks and Transformers applied for stock market forecasting. Furthermore this work also reviews datasets, features, evaluation parameters and results of various methods. From the analysis done on various DL models we found that Graph Neural Networks and Transformer models have potential to interpret dynamic and non-linear patterns of financial time series data with greater accuracy. In addition to this, correlation among various stock indices and investors sentiment along with historical data has great influence on the prediction accuracy. We also identified the benchmark datasets for stock market forecasting based on market capitalization value of an economy. The aim of this paper is to provide insight into most recent work done in the finance domain and identify future directions for more accurate predictions.",10.1145/3584871.3584872,2023,,ACM
"A Comprehensive Benchmark on Spectral GNNs: The Impact on Efficiency, Memory, and Effectiveness","With recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs), spectral GNNs have received increasing popularity by virtue of their ability to retrieve graph signals in the spectral domain. These models feature uniqueness in efficient computation as well as rich expressiveness, which stems from advanced management and profound understanding of graph data. However, few systematic studies have been conducted to assess spectral GNNs, particularly in benchmarking their efficiency, memory consumption, and effectiveness in a unified and fair manner. There is also a pressing need to select spectral models suitable for learning specific graph data and deploying them to massive web-scale graphs, which is currently constrained by the varied model designs and training settings.In this work, we extensively benchmark spectral GNNs with a focus on the spectral perspective, demystifying them as spectral graph filters. We analyze and categorize 35 GNNs with 27 corresponding filters, spanning diverse formulations and utilizations of the graph data. Then, we implement the filters within a unified spectral-oriented framework with dedicated graph computations and efficient training schemes. In particular, our implementation enables the deployment of spectral GNNs over million-scale graphs and various tasks with comparable performance and less overhead. Thorough experiments are conducted on the graph filters with comprehensive metrics on effectiveness and efficiency, offering novel observations and practical guidelines that are only available from our evaluations across graph scales. Different from the prevailing belief, our benchmark reveals an intricate landscape regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of spectral graph filters, demonstrating the potential to achieve desirable performance through tailored spectral manipulation of graph data.",10.1145/3749156,2025,,ACM
Uncertainty-Aware Probabilistic Travel Time Prediction for On-Demand Ride-Hailing at DiDi,"Travel Time Estimation (TTE) aims to accurately forecast the expected trip duration from an origin to a destination. As one of the world's largest ride-hailing platforms, DiDi answers billions of TTE queries per day. The quality of TTE directly decides the customer's experience and the effectiveness of passenger-to-driver matching. However, existing studies mainly regard TTE as a deterministic regression problem and focus on improving the prediction accuracy of a single label, which overlooks the travel time uncertainty induced by various dynamic contextual factors. To this end, in this paper, we propose a probabilistic framework, ProbTTE, for uncertainty-aware travel time prediction. Specifically, the framework first transforms the single-label regression task to a multi-class classification problem to estimate the implicit travel time distribution. Moreover, we propose an adaptive local label-smoothing scheme to capture the ordinal inter-class relationship among soft travel time labels. Furthermore, we construct a route-wise log-normal distribution regularizer to absorb prior knowledge from large-scale historical trip data. By explicitly considering the travel uncertainty, the proposed approach not only improves the TTE accuracy but also provides additional travel time information to benefit downstream tasks in ride-hailing. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework compared with state-of-the-art travel time prediction algorithms. In addition, ProbTTE has been deployed in production at DiDi in late 2022 to empower various order dispatching services, and improves passenger and driver experiences significantly.",10.1145/3580305.3599925,2023,,ACM
Root Cause Analysis for Microservice Systems via Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback,"In microservice systems, the identification of root causes of anomalies is imperative for service reliability and business impact. This process is typically divided into two phases: (i)constructing a service dependency graph that outlines the sequence and structure of system components that are invoked, and (ii) localizing the root cause components using the graph, traces, logs, and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as latency. However, both phases are not straightforward due to the highly dynamic and complex nature of the system, particularly in large-scale commercial architectures like Microsoft Exchange.In this paper, we propose a new framework that employs Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (HRLHF) to address these challenges. Our framework leverages the static topology of the microservice system and efficiently employs the feedback of engineers to reduce uncertainty in the discovery of the service dependency graph. The framework utilizes reinforcement learning to reduce the number of queries required from O(N2) to O(1), enabling the construction of the dependency graph with high accuracy and minimal human effort. Additionally, we extend the discovered dependency graphs to window causal graphs that capture the characteristics of time series over a specified time period, resulting in improved root cause analysis accuracy and robustness. Evaluations on both real datasets from Microsoft Exchange and synthetic datasets with injected anomalies demonstrate superior performance on various metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods. It is worth mentioning that, our framework has been integrated as a crucial component in Microsoft M365 Exchange service.",10.1145/3580305.3599934,2023,,ACM
MSDR: Multi-Step Dependency Relation Networks for Spatial Temporal Forecasting,"Spatial temporal forecasting plays an important role in improving the quality and performance of Intelligent Transportation Systems. This task is rather challenging due to the complicated and long-range spatial temporal dependencies in traffic network. Existing studies typically employ different deep neural networks to learn the spatial and temporal representations so as to capture the complex and dynamic dependencies. In this paper, we argue that it is insufficient to capture the long-range spatial dependencies from the implicit representations learned by temporal extracting modules. To address this problem, we propose Multi-Step Dependency Relation (MSDR), a brand new variant of recurrent neural network. Instead of only looking at the hidden state from only one latest time step, MSDR explicitly takes those of multiple historical time steps as the input of each time unit. We also develop two strategies to incur the spatial information into the dependency relation embedding between multiple historical time steps and the current one in MSDR. On the basis of it, we propose the Graph-based MSDR (GMSDR) framework to support general spatial temporal forecasting applications by seamlessly integrating graph-based neural networks with MSDR. We evaluate our proposed approach on several popular datasets. The results show that the proposed GMSDR framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an obvious margin.",10.1145/3534678.3539397,2022,,ACM
A Universal Sets-level Optimization Framework for Next Set Recommendation,"Next Set Recommendation (NSRec), encompassing related tasks such as next basket recommendation and temporal sets prediction, stands as a trending research topic. Although numerous attempts have been made on this topic, there are certain drawbacks: (i) Existing studies are still confined to utilizing objective functions commonly found in Next Item Recommendation (NIRec), such as binary cross entropy and BPR, which are calculated based on individual item comparisons; (ii) They place emphasis on building sophisticated learning models to capture intricate dependency relationships across sequential sets, but frequently overlook pivotal dependency in their objective functions; (iii) Diversity factor within sequential sets is frequently overlooked. In this research, we endeavor to unveil a universal and Sets-level optimization framework for Next Set Recommendation (SNSRec), offering a holistic fusion of diversity distribution and intricate dependency relationships within temporal sets. To realize this, the following contributions are made: (i) We directly model the temporal set in a sequence as a cohesive entity, leveraging the Structured Determinantal Point Process (SDPP), wherein the probabilistic DPP distribution prioritizes collections of structures (sequential sets) instead of individual items; (ii) We introduce a co-occurrence representation to discern and acknowledge the importance of different sets; (iii) We propose a sets-level optimization criterion, which integrates the diversity distribution and dependency relations across the entire sequence of sets, guiding the model to recommend relevant and diversified set. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach consistently outperforms previous methods on both relevance and diversity.",10.1145/3627673.3679610,2024,,ACM
Session-Based News Recommendation from Temporal User Commenting Dynamics,"With the increase in volume of daily online news items, it is more and more difficult for readers to identify news articles relevant to their interests. Thus, effective recommendation systems are critical for an effective user news consumption experience. Existing news recommendation methods usually rely on the news click history to model user interest. However, there are other signals about user behaviors, such as user commenting activity, which have not been used before. We propose a recommendation algorithm that predicts articles a user may be interested in, given her historical sequential commenting behavior on news articles. We show that following this sequential user behavior the news recommendation problem falls into in the class of session-based recommendation. The techniques in this class seek to model users' sequential and temporal behaviors. While we seek to follow the general directions in this space, we face unique challenges specific to news in modeling temporal dynamics, e.g., users' interests shift over time, users comment irregularly on articles, and articles are perishable items with limited lifespans. We propose a recency-regularized neural attentive framework for session-based news recommendation. The proposed method is able to capture the temporal dynamics of both users and news articles, while maintaining interpretability. We design a lag-aware attention and a recency regularization to model the time effect of news articles and comments. We conduct extensive empirical studies on 3 real-world news datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",10.1109/asonam55673.2022.10068595,2023,,ACM
Enhancing Dependency Dynamics in Traffic Flow Forecasting via Graph Risk Bootstrap,"Graph neural networks, as well as attention mechanisms, have gained widespread popularity for traffic flow forecasting due to their capacity to incorporate the complicated interactions behind flow dynamics. However, existing solutions either formulate a graph-based skeleton with narrow (e.g., static) interaction capture or build the spatiotemporal (e.g., dynamic) attention without proper comprehension of diverse risks, which inevitably burdens the generalization of high-accuracy traffic trends. In this study, we introduce Gboot (Graph bootstrap) enhancement framework for traffic flow forecasting. Gboot takes the traffic flow forecasting problem from a dependency dynamic learning perspective by treating each traffic sensor as the graph node while regarding the observed flows at each sensor as the node feature. In addition to exposing the explicit spatial connectivity behind traffic flows, we hierarchically devise temporal-aware and factual-aware graph learning blocks to consider temporal interactive dynamics and factual interactive dynamics. The former shows the trend dependencies behind flow signals and the latter uncovers different views of traffic situations (e.g., current observation vs. historical observation). More importantly, we present a Dual-view Bootstrap (DvBoot) mechanism in Gboot, which includes both risk-free and risk-aware stands. DvBoot attempts to flexibly align these two views in the latent space to enhance the generalization capability of capturing dynamic dependencies. Experiments on several real-world traffic datasets demonstrate the superiority of our Gboot over representative approaches.",10.1145/3678717.3691237,2024,,ACM
Long Short-term Dynamic Graph Neural Networks: for short-term intense rainfall forecasting,"In practice, accurate and timely forecasting of short-term intense rainfall is critical, but the problem is extremely difficult because to its complicated spatial-temporal association. Although several spatial-temporal series forecasting methods have been used to rainfall prediction, these models continue to suffer from inadequate modeling of data’s complicated intrinsic connection. We provide a new short-term intense rainfall prediction model that use two graph generators to model data correlations under distinct semantics, followed by a graph convolution module for information integration to fully extract data spatial-temporal information. Finally, a variant of recurrent neural network is employed to extract the temporal dependence. The experimental results on both datasets show that the model can model the spatial and temporal dependence across the data more effectively than the baseline model, and further improve the model’s predictive performance for short-term intense rainfall.",10.1145/3578741.3578757,2023,,ACM
Dynamic and Multi-faceted Spatio-temporal Deep Learning for Traffic Speed Forecasting,"Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNNs) have become one of the most promising methods for traffic speed forecasting. However, when adapting DGNNs for traffic speed forecasting, existing approaches are usually built on a static adjacency matrix (no matter predefined or self-learned) to learn spatial relationships among different road segments, even if the impact of two road segments can be changeable dynamically during a day. Moreover, the future traffic speed cannot only be related with the current traffic speed, but also be affected by other factors such as traffic volumes. To this end, in this paper, we aim to explore these dynamic and multi-faceted spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in traffic data for further unleashing the power of DGNNs for better traffic speed forecasting. Specifically, we design a dynamic graph construction method to learn the time-specific spatial dependencies of road segments. Then, a dynamic graph convolution module is proposed to aggregate hidden states of neighbor nodes to focal nodes by message passing on the dynamic adjacency matrices. Moreover, a multi-faceted fusion module is provided to incorporate the auxiliary hidden states learned from traffic volumes with the primary hidden states learned from traffic speeds. Finally, experimental results on real-world data demonstrate that our method can not only achieve the state-of-the-art prediction performances, but also obtain the explicit and interpretable dynamic spatial relationships of road segments.",10.1145/3447548.3467275,2021,,ACM
A Graph-Based Framework for Temporal and Causal Analysis of Sentiments,"This research aims to develop a novel framework that uncovers the causal influence of global events on public sentiment through temporal graph modeling and neural causal inference. Global events, such as pandemics, elections, and economic crises, profoundly affect public sentiments, shaping social behaviors and economic outcomes. Traditional models often fall short in capturing the complex, dynamic, and non-linear relationships between these events and sentiments. This article presents the Neural Temporal Causal Graph Network (NTCGN), a unified framework that integrates temporal graph neural networks with a Causal Attention Network (CAN) to model and interpret these relationships. NTCGN constructs a temporal graph from event data and sentiment-labeled texts, learning dependencies and causal influences through advanced neural architectures. A thorough comparative analysis with state-of-the-art models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, LSTM, and transformer-based models demonstrates NTCGN’s superior performance. Experimental evaluation using the Sentiment140 and Global Database of Events, Language and Tone (GDELT) 2.0 datasets shows NTCGN achieving an accuracy of 0.798 and an F1 score of 0.795, outperforming these baseline models. The model’s causal inference capabilities are validated using the Causal Impact Score (CIS) and Causal Discovery Precision (CDP), highlighting its reliability in identifying true causal links. Visualizations of attention maps and causal pathways enhance interpretability, demonstrating how specific events influence public sentiments. This work provides a robust and interpretable tool for analyzing event-driven sentiment dynamics in real-world applications.",10.1145/3759440,2025,,ACM
Hierarchically Structured Transformer Networks for Fine-Grained Spatial Event Forecasting,"Spatial event forecasting is challenging and crucial for urban sensing scenarios, which is beneficial for a wide spectrum of spatial-temporal mining applications, ranging from traffic management, public safety, to environment policy making. In spite of significant progress has been made to solve spatial-temporal prediction problem, most existing deep learning based methods based on a coarse-grained spatial setting and the success of such methods largely relies on data sufficiency. In many real-world applications, predicting events with a fine-grained spatial resolution do play a critical role to provide high discernibility of spatial-temporal data distributions. However, in such cases, applying existing methods will result in weak performance since they may not well capture the quality spatial-temporal representations when training triple instances are highly imbalanced across locations and time. To tackle this challenge, we develop a hierarchically structured Spatial-Temporal ransformer network (STtrans) which leverages a main embedding space to capture the inter-dependencies across time and space for alleviating the data imbalance issue. In our STtrans framework, the first-stage transformer module discriminates different types of region and time-wise relations. To make the latent spatial-temporal representations be reflective of the relational structure between categories, we further develop a cross-category fusion transformer network to endow STtrans with the capability to preserve the semantic signals in a fully dynamic manner. Finally, an adversarial training strategy is introduced to yield a robust spatial-temporal learning under data imbalance. Extensive experiments on real-world imbalanced spatial-temporal datasets from NYC and Chicago demonstrate the superiority of our method over various state-of-the-art baselines.",10.1145/3366423.3380296,2020,,ACM
An Onboard UAV Multi-task System for Trajectory Prediction and State Estimation Employing Transformer- and Reservoir-based Networks,"With the increasing technological advancements and deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in different applications (e.g., delivery services, surveillance, critical infrastructure monitoring, military operations, and search-and-rescue operations), a robust, lightweight, and accurate system for UAV state identification and trajectory prediction is becoming a mandate. This work introduces an onboard real-time multi-task learning framework that combines Transformer neural networks and reservoir computing (RC) architectures to enhance outdoor UAV operations. The proposed system employs the Transformer-based architecture to capture the temporal dependencies in sequential data for long-term horizons, while RC-based networks are utilized to ensure robust and real-time performance. Specifically, custom multi-task models are implemented and fine-tuned to collect multi-modal sensor measurements, aiming to enhance the two-fold objective of simultaneous UAV state identification and trajectory prediction through shared feature learning. A dataset comprised of measurements collected from real-world UAV operations (in 3D space) under various conditions is employed to train and evaluate the proposed system. Furthermore, a prototype onboard UAV system is implemented and tested in real-world field experiments. Extensive evaluations of the experimental results demonstrate that the onboard framework achieves accuracy close to the ground truth in both state identification and trajectory prediction, consequently showcasing its potential for practical applications.",10.1145/3725893,2025,,ACM
CLOCK: Online Temporal Hierarchical Framework for Multi-scale Multi-granularity Forecasting of User Impression,"User impression forecasting underpins various commercial activities, from long-term strategic decisions to short-term automated operations. As a representative that involves both kinds, the highly profitable Guaranteed Delivery (GD) advertising focuses mainly on promoting brand effect by allowing advertisers to order target impressions weeksin advance and get allocatedonline at the scheduled time. Such a business mode naturally incurs three issues making existing solutions inferior: 1) Timescale-granularity dilemma of coherently supporting the sales of day-level impressions of the distant future and the corresponding fine-grained allocation in real-time. 2) High dimensionality due to the Cartesian product of user attribute combinations. 3) Stability-plasticity dilemma of instant adaptation to emerging patterns of temporal dependency withoutcatastrophic forgetting of repeated ones facing the non-stationary traffic.To overcome the obstacles, we propose an online temporal hierarchical framework that functions analogously to a CLOCK and hence its name. Long-timescale, coarse-grained temporal data (e.g., the daily impression of one quarter) and short-timescale but fine-grained ones are handled separately by dedicated models, just like the hour/minute/second hands. Each tier in the hierarchy is triggered for forecasting and updating by need at different frequencies, thus saving the maintenance overhead. Furthermore, we devise a reconciliation mechanism to coordinate tiers by aggregating the separately learned local variance and global trends tier by tier. CLOCK solves the dimensionality dilemma by subsuming the autoencoder design to achieve an end-to-end, nonlinear factorization of streaming data into a low-dimension latent space, where a neural predictor produces predictions for the decoder to project them back to the high dimension. Lastly, we regulate the CLOCK's continual refinement by combining the complementary Experience Replay (ER) and Knowledge Distillation (KD) techniques to consolidate and recall previously learned temporal patterns. We conduct extensive evaluations on three public datasets and the real-life user impression log from the Tencent advertising system, and the results demonstrate CLOCK's efficacy.",10.1145/3583780.3614810,2023,,ACM
Weighted Knowledge Graph Embedding,"Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) aims to project both entities and relations in a knowledge graph (KG) into low-dimensional vectors. Indeed, existing KGs suffer from the data imbalance issue, i.e., entities and relations conform to a long-tail distribution, only a small portion of entities and relations occur frequently, while the vast majority of entities and relations only have a few training samples. Existing KGE methods assign equal weights to each entity and relation during the training process. Under this setting, long-tail entities and relations are not fully trained during training, leading to unreliable representations. In this paper, we propose WeightE, which attends differentially to different entities and relations. Specifically, WeightE is able to endow lower weights to frequent entities and relations, and higher weights to infrequent ones. In such manner, WeightE is capable of increasing the weights of long-tail entities and relations, and learning better representations for them. In particular, WeightE tailors bilevel optimization for the KGE task, where the inner level aims to learn reliable entity and relation embeddings, and the outer level attempts to assign appropriate weights for each entity and relation. Moreover, it is worth noting that our technique of applying weights to different entities and relations is general and flexible, which can be applied to a number of existing KGE models. Finally, we extensively validate the superiority of WeightE against various state-of-the-art baselines.",10.1145/3539618.3591784,2023,,ACM

A comparison of spatio-temporal prediction methods: a parking availability case study,"In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of Statistical, Machine Learning and Deep Learning spatio-temporal models for parking occupancy prediction1. We evaluate such models on three public datasets, which are enriched by a set of hand-crafted features to take into account the temporal and spatial components when they are not natively handled by a model. Two approaches for this regression task are investigated: a univariate one and a multivariate one. In the former, we build a separate model for each parking lot. In the latter, a single model is used to predict the availability of all parking lots so as to learn the interactions and the co-movements among all time-series. All models exhibit similar performance. However, we highlight the higher effectiveness of gradient boosted methods when encompassing both temporal and spatial awareness in the feature space and of deep-learning models that take into account the spatial structure of the data.",10.1145/3477314.3507035,2022,,ACM
Graph Anomaly Detection with Few Labels: A Data-Centric Approach,"Anomalous node detection in a static graph faces significant challenges due to the rarity of anomalies and the substantial cost of labeling their deviant structure and attribute patterns. These challenges give rise to data-centric problems, including extremely imbalanced data distributions and intricate graph learning, which significantly impede machine learning and deep learning methods from discerning the patterns of graph anomalies with few labels. While these issues remain crucial, much of the current research focuses on addressing the induced technical challenges, treating the shortage of labeled data as a given. Distinct from previous efforts, this work focuses on tackling the data-centric problems by generating auxiliary training nodes that conform to the original graph topology and attribute distribution. We categorize this approach as data-centric, aiming to enhance existing anomaly detectors by training them on our synthetic data. However, the methods for generating nodes and the effectiveness of utilizing synthetic data for graph anomaly detection remain unexplored in the realm. To answer these questions, we thoroughly investigate the denoising diffusion model. Drawing from our observations on the diffusion process, we illuminate the shifts in graph energy distribution and establish two principles for designing denoising neural networks tailored to graph anomaly generation. From the insights, we propose a diffusion-based graph generation method to synthesize training nodes, which can be promptly integrated to work with existing anomaly detectors. The empirical results on eight widely-used datasets demonstrate our generated data can effectively enhance the nine state-of-the-art graph detectors' performance.",10.1145/3637528.3671929,2024,,ACM
Fairness-Aware Graph Neural Networks: A Survey,"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become increasingly important due to their representational power and state-of-the-art predictive performance on many fundamental learning tasks. Despite this success, GNNs suffer from fairness issues that arise as a result of the underlying graph data and the fundamental aggregation mechanism that lies at the heart of the large class of GNN models. In this article, we examine and categorize fairness techniques for improving the fairness of GNNs. We categorize these techniques by whether they focus on improving fairness in the pre-processing, in-processing (during training), or post-processing phases. We discuss how such techniques can be used together whenever appropriate and highlight the advantages and intuition as well. We also introduce an intuitive taxonomy for fairness evaluation metrics, including graph-level fairness, neighborhood-level fairness, embedding-level fairness, and prediction-level fairness metrics. In addition, graph datasets that are useful for benchmarking the fairness of GNN models are summarized succinctly. Finally, we highlight key open problems and challenges that remain to be addressed.",10.1145/3649142,2024,,ACM
APAN: Asynchronous Propagation Attention Network for Real-time Temporal Graph Embedding,"To capture higher-order structural features, most GNN-based algorithms learn node representations incorporating k-hop neighbors' information. Due to the high time complexity of querying k-hop neighbors, most graph algorithms cannot be deployed in a giant dense temporal network to execute millisecond-level inference. This problem dramatically limits the potential of applying graph algorithms in certain areas, especially financial fraud detection. Therefore, we propose Asynchronous Propagation Attention Network, an asynchronous continuous time dynamic graph algorithm for real-time temporal graph embedding. Traditional graph models usually execute two serial operations: first graph querying and then model inference. Different from previous graph algorithms, we decouple model inference and graph computation to alleviate the damage of the heavy graph query operation to the speed of model inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve competitive performance while greatly improving the inference speed. The source code is published at a Github repository.",10.1145/3448016.3457564,2021,,ACM
TraStrainer: Adaptive Sampling for Distributed Traces with System Runtime State,"Distributed tracing has been widely adopted in many microservice systems and plays an important role in monitoring and analyzing the system. However, trace data often come in large volumes, incurring substantial computational and storage costs. To reduce the quantity of traces, trace sampling has become a prominent topic of discussion, and several methods have been proposed in prior work. To attain higher-quality sampling outcomes, biased sampling has gained more attention compared to random sampling. Previous biased sampling methods primarily considered the importance of traces based on diversity, aiming to sample more edge-case traces and fewer common-case traces. However, we contend that relying solely on trace diversity for sampling is insufficient, system runtime state is another crucial factor that needs to be considered, especially in cases of system failures. In this study, we introduce TraStrainer, an online sampler that takes into account both system runtime state and trace diversity. TraStrainer employs an interpretable and automated encoding method to represent traces as vectors. Simultaneously, it adaptively determines sampling preferences by analyzing system runtime metrics. When sampling, it combines the results of system-bias and diversity-bias through a dynamic voting mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that TraStrainer can achieve higher quality sampling results and significantly improve the performance of downstream root cause analysis (RCA) tasks. It has led to an average increase of 32.63\% in Top-1 RCA accuracy compared to four baselines in two datasets.",10.1145/3643748,2024,,ACM

Embracing Uncertainty for Equity in Resource Allocation in ML Training,"To reduce the Deep Learning (DL) model training time and hence resource consumption, it is critical to avoid stragglers. However, the dynamics and uncertainty features of resource availability pose a challenge to avoiding stragglers caused. To handle this challenge, we propose a Straggler-Avoiding job Scheduling approach (SAS), which smartly ensures that the tasks of a job receive resources with similar dynamics and uncertainty so that the tasks can complete at approximately the same time. Specifically, SAS uses an ML method to predict available resource amounts with probability in future times, groups nodes with similar available resource amounts and probabilities, and then assigns each job to one node group with the objective of minimizing job completion time (JCT). To reduce the decision making time, we also propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based scheduling approach (SAS-RL) that assigns each job to a node group. In addition, we propose a distributed parameter server (PS) load reassignment method to handle PS stragglers. Our trace-driven real experiments show that SAS reduce up to 45\% JCT and 63\% stragglers compared with existing job schedulers, and our PS load reassignment reduces up to 48\% JCT compared with the previous PS load distribution scheme.",10.1145/3605573.3605583,2023,,ACM
Multi-Head Spatio-Temporal Attention Mechanism for Urban Anomaly Event Prediction,"Timely forecasting the urban anomaly events in advance is of great importance to the city management and planning. However, anomaly event prediction is highly challenging due to the sparseness of data, geographic heterogeneity (e.g., complex spatial correlation, skewed spatial distribution of anomaly events and crowd flows), and the dynamic temporal dependencies.In this study, we propose M-STAP, a novel Multi-head Spatio-Temporal Attention Prediction approach to address the problem of multi-region urban anomaly event prediction. Specifically, M-STAP considers the problem from three main aspects: (1) extracting the spatial characteristics of the anomaly events in different regions, and the spatial correlations between anomaly events and crowd flows; (2) modeling the impacts of crowd flow dynamic of the most relevant regions in each time step on the anomaly events; and (3) employing attention mechanism to analyze the varying impacts of the historical anomaly events on the predicted data. We have conducted extensive experimental studies on the crowd flows and anomaly events data of New York City, Melbourne and Chicago. Our proposed model shows higher accuracy (41.91\% improvement on average) in predicting multi-region anomaly events compared with the state-of-the-arts.",10.1145/3478099,2021,,ACM
Parallel Connected LSTM for Matrix Sequence Prediction with Elusive Correlations,"This article is about a challenging problem called matrix sequence prediction, which is motivated from the application of taxi order prediction. Remarkably, the problem differs greatly from previous sequence prediction tasks in the sense that the time-wise correlations are quite elusive; namely, distant entries could be strongly correlated and nearby entries are unnecessarily related. Such distinct specifics make prevalent convolution-recurrence-based methods inadequate to apply. To remedy this trouble, we propose a novel architecture called Parallel Connected LSTM (PcLSTM), which integrates two new mechanisms, Multi-channel Linearized Connection (McLC) and Adaptive Parallel Unit (APU), into the framework of LSTM. Benefiting from the strengths of McLC and APU, our PcLSTM is able to handle well both the elusive correlations within each timestamp and the temporal dependencies across different timestamps, achieving state-of-the-art performance in a set of experiments demonstrated on synthetic and real-world datasets.",10.1145/3469437,2021,,ACM
Predicting COVID-19 Spread from Large-Scale Mobility Data,"To manage the COVID-19 epidemic effectively, decision-makers in public health need accurate forecasts of case numbers. A potential near real-time predictor of future case numbers is human mobility; however, research on the predictive power of mobility is lacking. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel model for epidemic forecasting based on mobility data, called mobility marked Hawkes model. The proposed model consists of three components: (1) A Hawkes process captures the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases. (2) A mark modulates the rate of infections, thus accounting for how the reproduction number R varies across space and time. The mark is modeled using a regularized Poisson regression based on mobility covariates. (3) A correction procedure incorporates new cases seeded by people traveling between regions. Our model was evaluated on the COVID-19 epidemic in Switzerland. Specifically, we used mobility data from February through April 2020, amounting to approximately 1.5 billion trips. Trip counts were derived from large-scale telecommunication data, i.e., cell phone pings from the Swisscom network, the largest telecommunication provider in Switzerland. We compared our model against various state-of-the-art baselines in terms of out-of-sample root mean squared error. We found that our model outperformed the baselines by 15.52\%. The improvement was consistently achieved across different forecast horizons between 5 and 21 days. In addition, we assessed the predictive power of conventional point of interest data, confirming that telecommunication data is superior. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to predict the spread of COVID-19 from telecommunication data. Altogether, our work contributes to previous research by developing a scalable early warning system for decision-makers in public health tasked with controlling the spread of infectious diseases.",10.1145/3447548.3467157,2021,,ACM
Block Popularity Prediction for Multimedia Storage Systems Using Spatial-Temporal-Sequential Neural Networks,"Predicting block popularity is of crucial importance for data placement in multi-tiered multimedia storage systems. Traditional methods, such as least recently used and exponential smoothing, are commonly employed to predict future block access frequencies and fail to achieve good performance for complex and changing access patterns. Recently, deep neural networks have brought great success to pattern recognition and prediction, which motivates us to introduce deep learning to solve the problem of block popularity prediction. In this paper, we first analyze and verify the temporal and spatial correlations among the multimedia I/O traces. Then, we design a multi-dimension feature to capture such correlations, which serves as the input of the designed deep neural network. A spatial-temporal-sequential neural network (STSNN) and its variants that capture the locality information, time dependency information, and block sequential information are proposed to predict the block popularity. We systematically evaluate our STSNN models against six baseline models from three different categories, i.e., heuristic methods, regression methods and neural network-based methods. Experiment results show that our proposed STSNN models are very promising for predicting block access frequencies under some of Huawei and Microsoft datasets and particularly achieve 2-6 times better performance compared with the baselines in terms of the I/O hit ratio, I/O recall rate and I/O prediction ratio under the Microsoft 64 MB-block dataset.",10.1145/3474085.3475495,2021,,ACM
SrVARM: State Regularized Vector Autoregressive Model for Joint Learning of Hidden State Transitions and State-Dependent Inter-Variable Dependencies from Multi-variate Time Series,"Many applications, e.g., healthcare, education, call for effective methods methods for constructing predictive models from high dimensional time series data where the relationship between variables can be complex and vary over time. In such settings, the underlying system undergoes a sequence of unobserved transitions among a finite set of hidden states. Furthermore, the relationships between the observed variables and their temporal dynamics may depend on the hidden state of the system. To further complicate matters, the hidden state sequences underlying the observed data from different individuals may not be aligned relative to a common frame of reference. Against this background, we consider the novel problem of jointly learning the state-dependent inter-variable relationships as well as the pattern of transitions between hidden states from multi-variate time series data. To solve this problem, we introduce the State-Regularized Vector Autoregressive Model (SrVARM) which combines a state-regularized recurrent neural network to learn the dynamics of transitions between discrete hidden states with an augmented autoregressive model which models the inter-variable dependencies in each state using a state-dependent directed acyclic graph (DAG). We propose an efficient algorithm for training SrVARM by leveraging a recently introduced reformulation of the combinatorial problem of optimizing the DAG structure with respect to a scoring function into a continuous optimization problem. We report results of extensive experiments with simulated data as well as a real-world benchmark that show that SrVARM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in recovering the unobserved state transitions and discovering the state-dependent relationships among variables.",10.1145/3442381.3450116,2021,,ACM
CPInformer for Efficient and Robust Compound-Protein Interaction Prediction,"Recently, deep learning has become the mainstream methodology for Compound-Protein Interaction (CPI) prediction. However, the existing compound-protein feature extraction methods have some issues that limit their performance. First, graph networks are widely used for structural compound feature extraction, but the chemical properties of a compound depend on functional groups rather than graphic structure. Besides, the existing methods lack capabilities in extracting rich and discriminative protein features. Last, the compound-protein features are usually simply combined for CPI prediction, without considering information redundancy and effective feature mining. To address the above issues, we propose a novel CPInformer method. Specifically, we extract heterogeneous compound features, including structural graph features and functional class fingerprints, to reduce prediction errors caused by similar structural compounds. Then, we combine local and global features using dense connections to obtain multi-scale protein features. Last, we apply ProbSparse self-attention to protein features, under the guidance of compound features, to eliminate information redundancy, and to improve the accuracy of CPInformer. More importantly, the proposed method identifies the activated local regions that link a CPI, providing a good visualisation for the CPI state. The results obtained on five benchmarks demonstrate the merits and superiority of CPInformer over the state-of-the-art approaches.",10.1109/tcbb.2022.3144008,2022,,ACM
Vertically Autoscaling Monolithic Applications with CaaSPER: Scalable Container-as-a-Service Performance Enhanced Resizing Algorithm for the Cloud,"Kubernetes has emerged as a prominent open-source platform for managing cloud applications, including stateful databases. These monolithic applications rely on vertical scaling, adjusting CPU cores based on load fluctuations. However, our analysis of Kubernetes-based Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) offerings at Microsoft revealed that many customers consistently over-provision resources for peak workloads, neglecting cost-saving opportunities through resource scale-down. We found that there is a gap in the ability of existing vertical autoscaling tools to minimize resource slack and respond promptly to throttling, leading to increased costs and impacting crucial metrics such as throughput and availability.To address this challenge, we propose CaaSPER, a vertical autoscaling algorithm that blends reactive and proactive strategies. By dynamically adjusting CPU resources, CaaSPER minimizes resource slack, maintains optimal CPU utilization, and reduces throttling. Importantly, customers have the flexibility to prioritize either cost savings or high performance based on their preferences. Extensive testing demonstrates that CaaSPER effectively reduces throttling and keeps CPU utilization within target levels. CaaSPER is designed to be application-agnostic and platform-agnostic, with potential for extension to other applications requiring vertical autoscaling.",10.1145/3626246.3653378,2024,,ACM
A Recurrent Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network Based on Latent Time Graph for Multi-Channel Time Series Forecasting,"With the advancement of technology, the field of multi-channel time series forecasting has emerged as a focal point of research. In this context, spatio-temporal graph neural networks have attracted significant interest due to their outstanding performance. An established approach involves integrating graph convolutional networks into recurrent neural networks. However, this approach faces difficulties in capturing dynamic spatial correlations and discerning the correlation of multi-channel time series signals. Another major problem is that the discrete time interval of recurrent neural networks limits the accuracy of spatio-temporal prediction. To address these challenges, we propose a continuous spatio-temporal framework, termed Recurrent Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network based on Latent Time Graph (RST-LTG). RST-LTG incorporates adaptive graph convolution networks with a time embedding generator to construct a latent time graph, which subtly captures evolving spatial characteristics by aggregating spatial information across multiple time steps. Additionally, to improve the accuracy of continuous time modeling, we introduce a gate enhanced neural ordinary differential equation that effectively integrates information across multiple scales. Empirical results on four publicly available datasets demonstrate that the RST-LTG model outperforms 19 competing methods in terms of accuracy.",10.1109/lsp.2024.3479917,2024,7,IEEE
Global-local Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network for Power Load Forecasting,"Accurate power load forecasting is crucial for efficient grid management, benefiting production and living. However, traditional methods based on recurrent neural network fail to capture spatial details and complex inter-enterprise relationships, leading to prediction accuracy limitations. To solve this problem, this paper uses graph neural network (GNN) to capture the complex enterprises relationships, and recurrent neural network (RNN) to capture the spatiotemporal power load dependencies. Moreover, the unique characteristics of enterprise power consumption mode make local feature also an important factor in multivariable power load forecasting. Finally, a Global-local Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (GL-STGNN) model is proposed to improve the accuracy of power load forecasting. The model uses GRU and GCN to capture spatiotemporal dependence, discrete Fourier transform (DFT)to extract frequency domain features, and node Embedding to fuse features in encoders and decoders, thus comprehensively considering local features and global information. Experiments show improved accuracy and practical forecasting effectiveness over traditional approaches.",10.1109/iccepe62686.2024.10931504,2024,,IEEE
$\mathrm{S}^{2}$-GNN: Time Series Forecasting with a Multi-Scale Adaptive Graph Neural Network Integrating Spatial and Spectral Graph Convolutions,"Existing multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) methods have begun to explore architectures built entirely upon Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Directly connecting variables across different timestamps with a fully connected adjacency matrix introduces unnecessary noise and ignores the inherent temporal ordering between nodes. Besides this, the limited depth of Spatial graph convolutional layers restricts the ability of the model to capture long-term dependencies. We propose $\text{S}^{\text{2}}$-$\text{GNN}$, a multi-scale adaptive graph neural network method, which fusion spatial and spectral graph convolutions. An adaptive mechanism is used to capture the unidirectional relationship between nodes at different timestamps, which enables the construction of a graph structure that preserves the temporal order. Multi-order neighbor information and original node features are fused at each layer of spatial graph convolution to improve the local feature extraction capability of the spatial graph convolution. $\text{S}^{\text{2}}$-GNN introduces spectral graph convolution and applies singular value decomposition (SVD) in the frequency domain to decompose the adjacency matrix and implement spectral graph convolution, which enables the extraction of key structural information and provides a compact representation of global spatio-temporal dependencies. We conduct extensive experiments on 7 public datasets for time series forecasting. The experimental results show that the $\text{S}^{\text{2}}$-GNN outperforms typical baseline models in time series forecasting tasks.",10.1109/ispa67752.2025.00084,2025,,IEEE
Multi-site Forecasting of Energy Time Series with Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks,"Climate change has prompted the energy sector to shift its focus to renewable energy sources, which are environmentally friendly but less in terms of cost, complexity, and plants' management. It becomes critical to have a reliable method for estimating the output power of these systems, which are dispersed across the country and vary in kind and technology, and whose output power is mostly determined by meteorological factors. In this paper, we exploit the capability of modeling dynamic graph-like data of a specific type of graph neural network, spatio-temporal graph neural network, which can process spatial information about plants' distribution in a particular region as well as temporal data on individual plant power production. Plants in the same region can share information and make more accurate forecasts in this way. The suggested model was evaluated on two types of datasets: one with data gathered from real photovoltaic systems and the other with synthesized power time series reconstructed from data acquired by satellite detection. Our studies discovered how these systems can estimate the production outputs of photovoltaic stations simultaneously and with higher accuracy with respect to previous state-of-the-art models, performing effectively even in the absence of meteorological data.",10.1109/ijcnn55064.2022.9892160,2022,4,IEEE
Limited Data Forecasting of Financial Time-Series Using Graph-Based Class Dynamics,"This paper addresses the issue of limited data in financial time series forecasting, a challenge regularly faced in the context of newly listed companies. While deep learning models excel at learning relevant representations for forecasting, their efficacy is hindered by the need for substantial data. To over-come this limitation, we propose a forecasting model that takes advantage of transfer learning using graph neural networks. Our model is constructed based on the assumption that a company's stock price is affected not only by the pertinent economic factors specific to the company but also by the shared class-specific factors within its business sector. The model comprises three neural network modules: $i$) a module that captures the individual dynamics of a company, ii) a graph neural network (GNN) that captures class-specific dynamics in which the graph is learned from the data, and iii) a module that integrates both the individual and the class-specific dynamics. We propose a novel transfer learning approach to train the GNN, enhancing its efficiency in forecasting time series with limited historical data. Experimental results on real financial time series demonstrate improved forecasting accuracy when incorporating information from class-specific time series.",10.23919/eusipco63174.2024.10714981,2024,,IEEE
Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Aggregate Load Forecasting,"Accurate forecasting of electricity demand is a core component of the modern electricity infrastructure. Several approaches exist that tackle this problem by exploiting modern deep learning tools. However, most previous works focus on predicting the total load as a univariate time series forecasting task, ignoring all fine-grained information captured by the smart meters distributed across the power grid. We introduce a methodology to account for this information in the graph neural network framework. In particular, we consider spatio-temporal graphs where each node is associated with the aggregate load of a cluster of smart meters, and a global graph-level attribute indicates the total load on the grid. We propose two novel spatio-temporal graph neural network models to process this representation and take advantage of both the finer-grained information and the relationships existing between the different clusters of meters. We compare these models on a widely used, openly available, benchmark against a competitive baseline which only accounts for the total load profile. Within these settings, we show that the proposed methodology improves forecasting accuracy.",10.1109/ijcnn55064.2022.9892780,2022,4,IEEE
Spatial Temporal Graph Transformers for Probabilistic Load Forecasting,"Ensuring a balance between electricity supply and demand is crucial for effective energy generation and scheduling. To this end, accurate probabilistic energy prediction is essential. In this paper, we introduce a novel transformer-based framework, Spatial Temporal Graph Transformers (STGT), designed to estimate probability distributions for future time series data. By combining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Transformers, STGT is able to extract both temporal and spatial features, ultimately resulting in more reliable and accurate probability predictions. The architecture of STGT consists of a transformer decoder to capture historical load data and a graph neural network to model the spatial relationships present across different user loads. Additionally, quantile regression is utilized to model load probability distributions. Through extensive experiments conducted on real-world load time series datasets, we demonstrate that STGT outperforms alternative approaches in both point prediction and probabilistic prediction accuracy.",10.1109/csis-iac60628.2023.10364082,2023,1,IEEE
Causal-TSF: A Causal Intervention Approach to Mitigate Confounding Bias in Time Series Forecasting,"Time series forecasting, aiming to learn models from historical data and predict future values in time series, is a fundamental research topic in machine learning. However, few efforts have been devoted to addressing the confounding effects in time series data, e.g., the historical data are affected by some hidden surrounding factors (i.e., confounders), leading to biased forecasting models for future data. This paper presents a causal intervention approach to eliminate the bias that is raised by some hidden confounders. By using a causal graph, we illustrate why hidden confounders can bring bias in time series forecasting and how to tackle it. We implement causal intervention by a deep architecture that consists of two modules, a Confounders Estimation module to estimate the hidden confounders and a Debiasing module to eliminate the confounding bias in the forecasting model via sampling on confounders. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on various time series datasets. The experiment results indicate that the proposed method can reduce the negative confounding effects in time series data, and it achieves superior gains over state-of-the-art baselines for time series forecasting.",10.1109/tkde.2025.3536107,2025,,IEEE
Multi-Level Knowledge Inheritance Graph Neural Network for Tobacco Pest Time-Series Forecasting,"The quality of tobacco raw materials is the decisive factor affecting the quality of cigarette products. The monitoring and forecasting of tobacco pest distribution in the factory is crucial in preventing the invasion of tobacco pests into the raw materials, thereby mitigating potential economic losses. However, traditional time series forecasting methods fail to deal with the multi-level spatial characteristics within the tobacco pest distribution data, therefore leading to poor forecasting performance. In this work, a multi-level knowledge inheritance graph network (MKIGN) is proposed to handle this problem. First, by creating virtual variables, a workshop-level dataset and a district-level dataset were generated from the original point-level dataset. Then, a multi-level graph network structure with an integrated knowledge inheritance strategy is designed, which will be applied to the two newly constructed datasets to capture the multi-level spatial characteristics of the tobacco pest distribution data.

STGNNM: Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Network with Mamba for Cellular Traffic Prediction,"Accurate long-term prediction of cellular traffic is a critical task in the rapidly developing field of intelligent communications. However, due to the high mobility of users and the complex scheduling mechanism within the network, cellular traffic data presents significant spatial-temporal dependencies, which pose a considerable challenge to long-term cellular traffic prediction. Although Transformer-based models perform well in dealing with long-term dependencies, their quadratic computational complexity leads to low efficiency and high overhead. Moreover, existing studies are often insufficient in dealing with the spatial-temporal correlation of cellular network traffic, limiting the further improvement of prediction accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel deep learning model, Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Network with Mamba (STGNNM). First, we introduce a bidirectional Mamba module to capture the dynamic characteristics of the time series. Second, we apply a double-view graph learning module. The Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) captures the characteristics of neighboring base stations, while the Graph Attention Network (GAT) records the relationships between distant base stations. Finally, the bidirectional Mamba module processes spatial-temporal features comprehensively. We conduct extensive experimental evaluations on a real-world cellular traffic dataset.

SFLGNN: Power Load Forecasting Based on Spectral-Frequency Learning and Graph Neural Network,"With the continuous development of modern power systems, accurate power load forecasting has gradually become a key issue in energy management. Compared to deep learning models, existing statistical-based prediction models are not well suited to learn how to represent power load data and mine the rich information in the data. In addition, power load data needs to consider both intra-series temporal correlation and inter-series correlation. Recently, attempts have been made to capture both correlations simultaneously, but most of the studies capture only temporal correlations in the time domain and use predefined a priori as inter-sequence relationships. In this paper, SFLGNN (Spectral-Frequency Learning Based Graph Neural Network) is designed for power load forecasting. SFLGNN effectively solves the problem by capturing both variable correlation and inter-sequence correlation using graph neural networks, and extracts important features through CP decomposition with multi-attention mechanism. In addition, SFLGNN enhances representation learning through Spectral-Frequency Learning. We performed comparative experiments, ablation experiments, and hyper-parameter sensitivity experiments on our collected dataset.

This method integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to capture temporal dynamics, such as price fluctuations, and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to model global dependencies between products. We represent demand data as a network where each product is a node, constructing three distinct graphs with different types of edges: (i) a weekly sales similarity graph, (ii) a customer-based relationship graph, and (iii) an invoice-based similarity graph.

DNGNN: Efficient Deep Noisy Graph Neural Network for Spatio-Temporal Series Forecasting,"Spatio-temporal series forecasting plays a vital role in the domain of multivariate time series prediction. By leveraging accurate and comprehensive spatio-temporal sequence prediction models, it becomes possible to extract higher-order spatio-temporal interactions between real-world connections, thereby contributing to smart city construction. Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have emerged as a highly effective approach for addressing spatio-temporal series prediction challenges. Nevertheless, most existing methods predominantly rely on traditional graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and their variants for spatial feature extraction. Due to inherent limitations such as over-smoothing, these models often constrain spatial feature encoding to shallow architectures, typically limited to 2-3 layers. Additionally, the presence of noisy data in real-world scenarios significantly impacts the prediction accuracy of existing STGNN models. In this paper, building upon the classic STGNN framework, we propose a graph neural network framework based on deep residual connections and noise injection mechanism to address the aforementioned issues. Specifically, inspired by the principles of initial residual connection and identity mapping, we proposed a deep spatio-temporal graph neural network framework of 12 layers to capture the high-dimensional interactions, while using noise injection mechanism to mitigate the adverse effects of noisy data. Sufficient experimental results on typical time-series datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.",10.1109/asens64990.2025.11011208,2025,,IEEE
A Neural Network Architecture for Spatiotemporal PM2.5 Forecasting,"PM2.5 concentrations have been increasing at an alarming rate, making it critical to precisely estimate their regional and temporal distributions. The task is complicated by the non-linear property of PM2.5 and the large number of geological and climatic elements that influence PM2.5 concentrations, as well as the difficulty inherent in modelling their varying spatiotemporal association. Conventional physical and statistical forecasting techniques fail at incorporating several variables and discovering intricate correlations, essential for reliable predictions. This paper proposes a graph neural network capable of modelling PM2.5 concentrations on real-world data by leveraging PM2.5 transport, domain knowledge and considering spatial correlation, by reworking PM2.5 historical data, meteorological and weather forecast data into graph data and employing graph isomorphism networks, similar to the Weisfeiler Lehman graph isomorphism test for powerful graph representation learning, an attention mechanism, and a dedicated recurrent neural network to model temporal distributions, to provide accurate forecasting.",10.1109/ic3sis54991.2022.9885669,2022,,IEEE
Multi-Scenario Cellular KPI Prediction Based on Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network,"With the increasing demand for high-quality telecommunication services, cellular KPI prediction becomes crucial for telecommunication network monitoring and management. In this work, we propose a novel framework for cellular KPI prediction, which considers its distribution discrepancy under different network operation scenarios. In particular, three specific predictors for normal, target alarm, and neighbor alarm scenarios are proposed based on spatiotemporal graph neural networks and unified through transfer learning. Temporal convolution and attention mechanism are embedded to model the impact of anomalies on KPIs and its propagation across neighboring cells according to the cellular network topology. An experiment on a real cellular KPI dataset shows the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-arts. Note to Practitioners—Cellular network KPI prediction under scenarios of network alarms is crucial to evaluate the impact of alarms on network services and guides cellular network maintenance policies. This problem is similar to a general multivariate time series prediction problem with data multimodality. However, the first challenge in our case is that, under different scenarios, i.e., normal, target alarm, and neighbor alarm, the effective information and spatiotemporal dependencies among KPIs are different. The second challenge is the imbalanced or sparse sample size for specific scenarios, deteriorating the model performance. This paper proposes a cellular KPI prediction framework consisting of three scenario-specific predictors with similar but different modules to process different scenario-specific data. To address the dataset imbalance across scenarios, we adopt a transfer learning strategy to unify the training and prediction of three predictors. The experiment results on a real cellular KPI dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework is more feasible and effective than the state-of-the-art models for multivariate time series prediction. Future research can consider developing maintenance policies such that the cost caused by abnormal KPIs can be minimized.",10.1109/tase.2024.3416952,2025,3,IEEE

HiGraph: Learning Hierarchical Graph for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection in Microservice Systems,"Microservices enable flexible, scalable, and efficient application development in cloud environments. A service instance is a chain of microservices running in virtual pods. The service invocation trace and the pod performance metrics are recorded and analyzed to detect anomalies and ensure system stability. Spatiotemporal graph neural network models are popular for time-series representation as they can capture intra- and inter-correlation of time series. However, we find that the performance of anomaly detection depends on the dynamic correlation between containers in microservice system greatly, but has not been considered in existing work. To capture the correlation both on pod level and metric level, we propose a hierachcical graph neural network model, HiGraph, cascading of MetricLayer and PodLayer modules. MetricLayer is used to compute the correlation between metrics through mutual information. PodLayer is used to learn the dynamical correlation of the pods from trace data. It is important to note that trace data continuously records calls, while metric data has a sampling interval, making temporal alignment difficult. To address this, we innovatively use the edge weights of the graph to align them. We count the call frequency between different pods in the trace data over a specific period to update the weights of the spatial correlation graph. Extensive experiments on real data demonstrate that HiGraph improves RMSE by 4.9%, MAE by 4.8%, F1-score by 4.2% and recall by 9.2% compared to the best baseline.",10.1109/wccct65447.2025.11028023,2025,,IEEE
QSTGNN: Quaternion Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks,"Spatio-temporal time series forecasting has attracted great attentions in various fields, including climate, power, and traffic forecasting. Recently, Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have shown promising performances in modeling spatial dependencies based on graph neural networks (GNNs) and temporal dependencies based on temporal learning modules. However, most STGNNs do not effectively integrate explicit and implicit relationships between nodes, nor do they adequately capture long and short-term time dependencies. To address these challenges, this paper presents a Quaternion Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Network (QSTGNN). Specifically, the quaternion spatio-temporal graph is constructed firstly, such that the information of both short and long-term time steps are preserved in quaternion feature tensor, and information of multiple explicit graphs and implicit graph are integrated in quaternion graph adjacency matrix. Then, two modules are designed: a 1D quaternion convolution module and a quaternion graph convolution module. In the 1D quaternion convolution module, complex temporal correlations among short and long-term time steps can be well exploited by 1D quaternion convolution operator based on the quaternion Hamilton product. In the quaternion graph convolution module, quaternion graph convolution is designed to characterize nonlinear dependencies among multiple spatial graphs, including explicit and implicit graphs. Extensive experiments are conducted on six datasets, and the results show that QSTGNN achieves state-of-the-art performances over the existing ten methods. Explainable analysis presents that multiple spatial correlations can accurately illustrate the traffic flow and road functional information in real traffic roads.",10.1109/tkde.2025.3571983,2025,,IEEE
SAGoG: Similarity-Aware Graph of Graphs Neural Networks for Multivariate Time Series Classification,"Multivariate Time Series Classification (MTSC) has important research significance and practical value. Deep learning models have achieved considerable success in addressing MTSC problems. However, a key challenge faced by existing classification models is how to effectively consider the correlations between time series instances and across channels simultaneously, as well as how to capture the dynamic of these inter-channel correlations over time. Current methods often fall short in these aspects: on one hand, they fail to fully account for the combined effects of inter-instance and inter-channel correlations; on the other hand, they largely overlook the dynamic nature of how inter-channel correlations change over time. To address these issues, we propose a novel graph neural network model, called Similarity-Aware Graph of Graphs neural networks (SAGoG), for multivariate time series classification. This model can comprehensively consider the dependencies between channel-level and instance-level time series, it dynamically learns dependency features through graph structure evolution and graph pooling layers. We conduct experiments on the UEA dataset to validate the SAGoG model, and the results demonstrate its outstanding performance in multivariate time series classification tasks.",10.1109/tkde.2025.3572216,2025,,IEEE
Towards Expressive Spectral-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Time Series Forecasting,"Time series forecasting has remained a focal point due to its vital applications in sectors such as energy management and transportation planning. Spectral-temporal graph neural network is a promising abstraction underlying most time series forecasting models that are based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However, more is needed to know about the underpinnings of this branch of methods. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework that unravels the expressive power of spectral-temporal GNNs. Our results show that linear spectral-temporal GNNs are universal under mild assumptions, and their expressive power is bounded by our extended first-order Weisfeiler–Leman algorithm on discrete-time dynamic graphs. To make our findings useful in practice on valid instantiations, we discuss related constraints in detail and outline a theoretical blueprint for designing spatial and temporal modules in spectral domains. Building on these insights and to demonstrate how powerful spectral-temporal GNNs are based on our framework, we propose a simple instantiation named Temporal Graph Gegenbauer Convolution (TGGC), which significantly outperforms most existing models with only linear components and shows better model efficiency.",10.1109/tpami.2025.3545671,2025,4,IEEE

Causalformer: Causal Discovery-based Transformer for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting,"The forecasting of time series is finding increasingly widespread applications in real-world scenarios, such as medical data and electricity consumption. Recent work primarily employs the Transformer and its variant to capture broad temporal dependencies from time series. However, most approaches often overly focus on the impact of temporal relation, while neglecting the interactions among multivariate elements, and lacking the application of causal relationships. Int the paper, we introduce a Transformer variant based on causal discovery to discover and utilize causal relationships, termed the Causalformer. Our Causalformer not only captures temporal features but also learns a Granger causality graph from multivariate time series, resulting in a sparse adjacency matrix that represents the causal relationships between variables. This allows us to leverage causal relationships to estimate the degree of influence among multivariate elements, thereby further enhancing forecast accuracy. Building upon this, we configure the decoder part as multi-headed output to utilize the causal matrix for understanding how each variable is influenced by others. To accelerate the model’s learning speed, we also design the decoder as generative, allowing it to output an extended time series sequence in a single shot rather than step-by-step, significantly improving inference efficiency. We conduct experiments on three datasets. In most cases, the forecast results were significantly better than other baselines, and the accuracy of causal discovery was not significantly different from that of SOTA.",10.1109/cisp-bmei60920.2023.10373365,2023,3,IEEE
Unified Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks: Data-Driven Modeling for Social Science,"Time series forecasting with additional spatial de-pendencies has attracted a tremendous amount of research interest in social sciences, due to its importance in modern real-world applications. The Graph Neural Networks (GNN) is one of the most exciting deep learning techniques among these spatio-temporal modeling approaches. Most existing spatio-temporal GNN frameworks are based on a two-step modeling process. In such scenario, spatial and temporal dependencies are modeled in separate steps, which lead to problems such as complex architecture design, hard to scale, etc. Targeting the shortcomings of existing studies, we take both spatial and temporal dependencies from another perspective, and consider them as two heterogeneous types of edges in the graph. We propose a unified spatio-temporal GNN framework that captures both dependencies in a single step. More specifically, for each node in the graph, a unified neural network component is designed to simultaneously extract information from its sur-rounding neighbors (spatial) and its past records (temporal), which enables much easier dependency aggregation with faster execution. Experiment results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework over state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines on various applications, including modeling smart cities and data-driven political science research.",10.1109/ijcnn55064.2022.9892911,2022,,IEEE
Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Transfer Entropy Graph,"Multivariate Time Series (MTS) forecasting is an essential problem in many fields. Accurate forecasting results can effectively help in making decisions. To date, many MTS forecasting methods have been proposed and widely applied. However, these methods assume that the predicted value of a single variable is affected by all other variables, ignoring the causal relationship among variables. To address the above issue, we propose a novel end-to-end deep learning model, termed graph neural network with neural Granger causality, namely CauGNN, in this paper. To characterize the causal information among variables, we introduce the neural Granger causality graph in our model. Each variable is regarded as a graph node, and each edge represents the casual relationship between variables. In addition, convolutional neural network filters with different perception scales are used for time series feature extraction, to generate the feature of each node.

MTAP-DK: Multivariate Time-Series Anomaly Prediction with Domain Knowledge,"Predicting anomalies of mobile equipment plays an important role in performing preventive maintenance, alleviating major economic losses and personal safety issues. Previous studies basically adopted data-driven models for anomaly prediction or detection of industrial equipment, ignoring the importance of domain knowledge. The domain knowledge can more accurately and theoretically capture the complex relationship among features.

Learning Latent ODEs With Graph RNN for Multi-Channel Time Series Forecasting,"Forecasting tasks involving multi-channel time series data pervade numerous practical applications and have attracted significant attention. Spatio-temporal graph neural network models for multi-channel time series forecasting have recently gained traction, owing to their ability in capturing both spatial and temporal features. A common practice is the integration of graph convolutional networks with recurrent neural networks. However, the discrete intervals of recurrent neural networks pose limitations on the temporal resolution of time series forecasting, impeding the model's ability to capture subtle changes in the data. To address this challenge, we introduce a continuous spatio-temporal framework, termed Graph Ordinary Differential Equation Recurrent Network (GODERN). GODERN incorporates continuous recurrent neural networks with a learnable and directed graph convolution layer to model the spatio-temporal dynamics in latent space. Furthermore, given the actual time representation in GODERN, we propose a novel augmented method of neural ordinary differential equation with fast-slow dynamics, thus allowing the encapsulation of multi-scale information. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that GODERN achieves superior accuracy on four real-life datasets, outperforming 13 baseline models.",10.1109/lsp.2023.3320439,2023,6,IEEE
Graph-Enabled Reinforcement Learning for Time Series Forecasting With Adaptive Intelligence,"Reinforcement learning (RL) is renowned for its proficiency in modeling sequential tasks and adaptively learning latent data patterns. Deep learning models have been extensively explored and adopted in regression and classification tasks. However, deep learning has limitations, such as the assumption of equally spaced and ordered data, and the inability to incorporate graph structure in time-series prediction. Graph Neural Network (GNN) can overcome these challenges by capturing the temporal dependencies in time-series data effectively. In this study, we propose a novel approach for predicting time-series data using GNN, augmented with Reinforcement Learning(GraphRL) for monitoring. GNNs explicitly integrate the graph structure of the data into the model, enabling them to naturally capture temporal dependencies. This approach facilitates more accurate predictions in complex temporal structures, as encountered in healthcare, traffic, and weather forecasting domains. We further enhance our GraphRL model's performance through fine-tuning with a Bayesian optimization technique. The proposed framework surpasses baseline models in time-series forecasting and monitoring.

Spatial-Temporal Aware Inductive Graph Neural Network for C-ITS Data Recovery,"With the prevalence of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), massive sensors are deployed on roadside, vehicles, and infrastructures. One key challenge is imputing several different types of missing entries in spatial-temporal traffic data to meet the high-quality demand of data science applied in Cooperative-ITS (C-ITS) since accurate data recovery is critical to many downstream tasks in ITSs, such as traffic monitoring and decision making. For such, it is proposed in this article solutions to three kinds of data recovery tasks in a unified model via spatial-temporal aware Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), named Spatial-Temporal Aware Data Recovery Network (STAR), enabling a real-time and inductive inference. A residual gated temporal convolution network is designed to permit the proposed model to learn the temporal pattern from long sequences with masks and an adaptive memory-based attention model for utilizing implicit spatial correlation. To further exploit the generalization power of GNNs, a sampling-based method is adopted to train the proposed model to be robust and inductive for online servicing.

PIDGeuN: Graph Neural Network-Enabled Transient Dynamics Prediction of Networked Microgrids Through Full-Field Measurement,"A Physics-Informed Dynamic Graph Neural Network (PIDGeuN) is presented to accurately, efficiently and robustly predict the nonlinear transient dynamics of microgrids in the presence of disturbances. The graph-based architecture of PIDGeuN provides a natural representation of the microgrid topology.

TCGPN: Temporal-Correlation Graph Pre-trained Network for Stock Forecasting,"The integration of temporal features and correlations across time series has emerged as an effective strategy in time series prediction.

However, their effectiveness and robustness are less satisfactory when applied to tasks that lack periodicity, such as stock market prediction, and they are constrained by memory limitations, rendering them unsuitable for problems with a large number of nodes. To address these challenges, we propose the Temporal-Correlation Graph Pre-trained Network (TCGPN), which utilizes a temporal-correlation fusion encoder for mixed representation and incorporates pre-training methods with carefully designed temporal and correlation tasks. The structure is independent of node number and order, enabling improved outcomes through various data augmentation techniques, and reduces memory consumption during training via multiple sampling strategies.

Context Integrated Relational Spatio-Temporal Resource Forecasting,"Traditional resource (demand or supply) forecasting models mainly focus on modeling temporal dependency. However, spatio-temporal data include complex non-linear relational and spatial dependencies. In addition, dynamic contextual information also impacts resources. Methods that consider context assume that the impact of context on resources is fixed, which is not realistic. For example, in a bicycle-sharing system, bike supply in stations is affected by the weather, and that effect changes over time. We propose a novel graph-based context integrated relational model, Context Integrated Graph Neural Network (CIGNN), which models temporal, relational, spatial, and dynamic contextual dependencies for multi-step ahead resource forecasting. We define a resource graph, where nodes represent locations with associated resource time-series, and context graphs (one for each type of context), where nodes represent locations with associated contextual time-series. Assuming that various contexts have dynamic impact on resources, our proposed CIGNN model employs a novel fusion mechanism that jointly learns from multiple contextual time-series. To the best of our knowledge, CIGNN is the first approach that integrates dynamic contextual information using graph neural networks for resource forecasting. Empirical results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that CIGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.",10.1109/bigdata52589.2021.9671705,2021,1,IEEE
Long-term Spatio-Temporal Forecasting using Spectral Graph Neural Networks,"Multivariate Time Series (MTS) forecasting is vital in various practical applications. Current research in this area is categorized into Spatial-Temporal Forecasting (STF) and Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF). While these tasks share similarities, the methods and benchmarks used differ significantly. Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) excel at modeling interrelationships in STF tasks but face difficulties with long sequence inputs due to inefficient training. In contrast, LTSF models handle long sequences well but struggle with capturing complex variable interrelationships. This paper proposes the Spectral Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (S2GNN) to address these challenges, proposing a framework capable of handling long-term spatiotemporal forecasting.

App Popularity Prediction by Incorporating Time-Varying Hierarchical Interactions,"App popularity prediction is a significant task in mobile service development, which predicts an app's future popularity based on its current behaviors. It provides benefits from app development to targeted investment. Popularity is affected by two factors, i.e., internal ones like reviews and external ones like interaction among apps. However, most related studies only explore internal factors but neglect external ones. In fact, external factor plays an important role in popularity prediction modelling since it is the promoting and/or inhibiting influence resulted by app interaction. The app interaction has two major characteristics, i.e., interactivity and dynamicity, which brings challenges to app popularity prediction due to two reasons: 1) interactivity—it is hard to evaluate the existence and influence intensity of interactions; 2) dynamicity—the nature of interaction influence, e.g., promoting or inhibiting, and its intensity on popularity change with time. In this paper, we propose DeePOP, a popularity prediction model that innovatively leverages time-varying hierarchical interactions. First, we propose Hierarchical Interaction Graph, which is first studied in this work, to organically characterize the relationship and influence among apps. Second, DeePOP integrates internal factors and time-varying hierarchical interactions as inputs to build the prediction model. It develops multi-level modules based on Recurrent Neural Network with attention mechanism and generates multi-step time series predictions by fusing the outputs of modules. Experiments on a real-world dataset show that DeePOP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy, effectively reducing the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to 0.088.",10.1109/tmc.2020.3029718,2022,11,IEEE

SGDP: A Stream-Graph Neural Network Based Data Prefetcher,"Data prefetching is important for storage system optimization and access performance improvement. Traditional prefetchers work well for mining access patterns of sequential logical block address (LBA) but cannot handle complex non-sequential patterns that commonly exist in real-world applications. The state-of-the-art (SOTA) learning-based prefetchers cover more LBA accesses. However, they do not adequately consider the spatial interdependencies between LBA deltas, which leads to limited performance and robustness.

Toward Nonuniformly Distributed Weather Forecasting: Adaptive Filtered Hypergraph Convolution Network,"Weather forecasting, compared to other multivariate time-series prediction tasks, exhibits notably nonuniform distribution of observation sites. The prevailing approaches primarily leverage graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) to extract spatial features. However, some studies suggest that the poor performance on uneven graphs is primarily due to the fact that traditional graph neural networks (GNNs) are essentially low-pass filters, discarding information beyond low-frequency information on the graph. From another perspective, since the essence of graph convolution is the smoothing of node features, for uneven graphs, there are noticeable differences in the smoothing rates of node features, leading to the coexistence of overfitting and underfitting phenomena. This issue is further exacerbated in higher order graph structures, such as hypergraphs, due to the irregular and complex nature of hyperedges. To address this issue, we propose a filtered hypergraph neural network. Building on the calculation of hypergraph node smoothing rates, we balance the low-pass and high-pass filter convolutions’ feature extraction through a dual-stream architecture. On uneven graphs, it can be observed that neglecting high-frequency information and concentrating solely on low-frequency information impede the learning of node representations, thereby significantly affecting the performance of downstream prediction tasks. We conducted multidimensional time-series prediction experiments using meteorological data, and the results demonstrate that our model performs with high accuracy in node regression tasks across multiple channels.",10.1109/tgrs.2025.3640219,2025,,IEEE
STCA-LLM: Spatial–Temporal Cross-Attention Large Language Model for Wind Speed Forecasting,"Accurately forecasting wind speed is crucial for efficiently utilizing the renewable energy, stabilizing the energy system and advancing the progress of the decarbonization of our society.

Moreover, the cross-attention module is innovatively proposed to establish the connections between spatial and temporal embeddings. Then, the spatial–temporal representation modules and the aligned LLM are fine-tuned in two-stage way.

Global and Local Interattribute Relationships-Based Graph Convolutional Network for Flight Trajectory Prediction,"The rapid development of the aviation industry urgently requires efficient airspace traffic management, in which flight trajectory prediction is a core component. Existing trajectory prediction methods mainly capture the relationships between trajectory points. However, there are complex and implicit relationships between the attributes of trajectory points. Furthermore, there is room for improvement when applying previous multivariate time series prediction methods on flight track forecasting, since both local and global attribute features and interattribute relationships have an important impact on the flight track features. In this article, we propose a global and local interattribute relationships-based graph convolutional network (GLAR-GCN) to solve the flight trajectory prediction problem. First, we fuse the local embedded attribute feature and global attribute pattern to obtain the accumulated local embedded features at each point. Meanwhile, we synthesize the local and global attribute correlations to obtain the augmented attribute correlations at each point. Second, we construct an attribute graph at each point, where the nodes are the accumulated local embedded features and the edges are the augmented attribute correlations. Third, we extract the integrated attribute features from each attribute graph with a graph convolutional network. Finally, we perform trajectory prediction with the integrated attribute features as the input of a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. We evaluate the proposed model GLAR-GCN on real short-haul, medium-haul, and long-haul flight datasets for single-step and multistep prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that GLAR-GCN effectively improves the prediction performance on all datasets compared with the classical and the state-of-the-art methods.",10.1109/taes.2024.3357668,2024,17,IEEE
Back to the Future: GNN-Based No2 Forecasting Via Future Covariates,"Due to the latest environmental concerns in keeping at bay contaminants emissions in urban areas, air pollution forecasting has been rising the forefront of all researchers around the world. When predicting pollutant concentrations, it is common to include the effects of environmental factors that influence these concentrations within an extended period, like traffic, meteorological conditions and geographical information. Most of the existing approaches exploit this information as past covariates, i.e., past exogenous variables that affected the pollutant but were not affected by it. In this paper, we present a novel forecasting methodology to predict NO2 concentration via both past and future covariates. Future covariates are represented by weather forecasts and future calendar events, which are already known at prediction time. In particular, we deal with air quality observations in a city-wide network of ground monitoring stations, modeling the data structure and estimating the predictions with a Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (STGNN). We propose a conditioning block that embeds past and future covariates into the current observations. After extracting meaningful spatiotemporal representations, these are fused together and projected into the forecasting horizon to generate the final prediction. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that future covariates are included in time series predictions in a structured way. Remarkably, we find that conditioning on future weather information has a greater impact than considering past traffic conditions. We release our code implementation at https://github.com/polimi-ispl/MAGCRN.",10.1109/igarss53475.2024.10642608,2024,,IEEE
Enhance COVID-19 Mortality Prediction with Human Mobility Trend and Medical Information,"In this work, we study national and state-level COVID-19 pandemic data in the United States with the help of human mobility trend data and auxiliary medical information. We analyze and compare various state-of-the-art time-series prediction techniques. We assess a spatio-temporal graph neural network model which forecasts the pandemic course by utilizing a hybrid deep learning architecture and human mobility data. Nodes in the graph represent the state-level deaths due to COVID-19 at any particular time point, edges represent the human mobility trend and temporal edges correspond to node attributes across time. We also study statistical modeling and machine learning techniques for mortality prediction in the United States. We evaluate these techniques on both state and national level COVID-19 data in the United States and claim that the SARIMAX and GCN-LSTM model generated forecast values using exogenous hospital information variables can enrich the underlying model to improve the prediction accuracy at both levels. Our best machine learning models perform 50% and 60% better than the baseline on an average on the national level and state-level data, respectively, while the statistical models perform 63% and 42% better.",10.1109/hpcc-dss-smartcity-dependsys53884.2021.00190,2021,,IEEE
Accurate Anomaly Detection Leveraging Knowledge-enhanced GAT,"Anomaly detection is a long-standing research topic to support the prompt remedy of potential risks for dependency-aware tasks, where Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) models have been adopted to differentiate anomalies from normal patterns. Generally, GNN models utilize time series data to construct graph structures for capturing task dependencies between Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such that deviations from predicted behaviours are assumed as anomalies. Current forecasting-based anomaly detection methods can hardly detect anomalies, which are uncovered by historical sensory data, but are explicitly specified by domain knowledge. To solve this issue, this paper proposes a Knowledge-enhanced graph attention-based Anomaly Detection (KeAD) method. Specifically, a knowledge-enhanced graph structure is constructed by incorporating domain-specific knowledge to represent spatio-temporal dependencies between IoT devices. Thereafter, a knowledge-enhanced graph attention-based forecasting network is developed to predict future behaviours of IoT devices. Anomalies are detected by analyzing deviations from these predicted behaviours, taking domain-specific knowledge into account. Extensive experiments are conducted based on publicly-available datasets, and evaluation results demonstrate that our KeAD outperform the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of the accuracy of anomaly detection.",10.1109/icws62655.2024.00077,2024,3,IEEE
A Review of Graph Neural Networks and Their Applications in Power Systems,"Deep neural networks have revolutionized many machine learning tasks in power systems, ranging from pattern recognition to signal processing. The data in these tasks are typically represented in Euclidean domains. Nevertheless, there is an increasing number of applications in power systems, where data are collected from non-Euclidean domains and represented as graph-structured data with high-dimensional features and interdependency among nodes.

Graph-Guided Neural Network for Tourism Demand Forecasting,"An accurate tourism demand forecasting model is crucial for tourism decision-makers. In recent years, several deep learning-based models have been developed to predict tourist arrivals via search intensity indices. However, few methods consider the lag effect in the long-term time range and the interaction between different search intensity indices factors. To alleviate the above limitations, we propose a graph-guided tourism demand forecasting network, which can model the lag effect of historical variables on future variables. Specifically, each variable is individually encoded via a convolutional neural network in the time dimension. Then, lag effects are modeled dynamically in a bipartite graph, and mined via graph aggregation. Finally, a fully-connected network is designed for regression prediction. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in both one-step and multi-step prediction compared with existing methods.",10.1109/access.2023.3336702,2023,6,IEEE

A Novel Spatial-Temporal Deep Neural Network for Electricity Price Forecasting,"Electricity price forecasting is a difficult task because it depends on various factors such as weather, fuel, load, and bidding strategies. These characteristics bring a lot of volatility to electricity prices. In addition, there exist coupling relationships between different price zones in Europe. CNN-based or LSTM-based methods cannot capture the relationship by their structures or there is a need to extract these couplings explicitly manually. In this work, an end-to-end graph neural network is proposed for the first time to learn the coupling between different price zones automatically. The proposed model mainly consists of two parts: a graph learning module and a temporal learning module, which both are designed to learn spatial information of different price zones and temporal information of historical data, respectively. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated on one-year public data collected from the Nord Pool.

Graph Portfolio: High-Frequency Factor Predictors via Heterogeneous Continual GNNs,"This study aims to address the challenges of financial price prediction in high-frequency trading (HFT) by introducing a novel continual learning framework based on factor predictors via graph neural networks. The model integrates multi-factor pricing theory with real-time market dynamics, effectively bypassing the limitations of conventional time series forecasting methods, which often lack financial theory guidance and ignore market correlations. We propose three heterogeneous tasks, including price gap regression, changepoint detection, and price moving average regression to trace the short-, intermediate-, and long-term trend factors present in the data. We also account for the cross-sectional correlations inherent in the financial market, where prices of different assets show strong dynamic correlations. To accurately capture these dynamic relationships, we resort to spatio-temporal graph neural network (STGNN) to enhance the predictive power of the model. Our model allows a continual learning strategy to simultaneously consider these tasks (factors). To tackle the catastrophic forgetting in continual learning while considering the heterogeneity of tasks, we propose to calculate parameter importance with mutual information between original observations and the extracted features. Empirical studies on the Chinese futures data and U.S. equity data demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.",10.1109/tkde.2025.3566111,2025,2,IEEE
Energy Data Forecasting Based on the STRLM Time Series Prediction Model,"We propose an improved model, the Seasonal-Trend Relational Large Language Model (STRLM), for time-series prediction, which enhances prediction accuracy in energy-related applications and achieves robust performance under data-scarce conditions.

Enhanced Prediction of Water Pipeline Failures Using a Novel MTGNN-Based Classification Model for Smart City Infrastructure,"Accurate prediction of waterpipe failures is critical for urban infrastructure resilience and operational efficiency, especially as smart city initiatives increasingly rely on data-driven approaches to manage infrastructure assets. Traditional machine learning models for predicting pipeline failures have limitations, often failing to capture the spatial dependencies intrinsic to interconnected water networks and falling short on short-term prediction accuracy. This study introduces a novel Multi-Task Graph Neural Network (MTGNN)-based classification method specifically designed to address these limitations by leveraging spatial and temporal dependencies. Using the Kitchener waterpipe failure dataset, the MTGNN-driven approach achieves precision rates of 0.69, 0.98, and 0.95 for six-month, one-year, and two-year prediction horizons, respectively. This improved accuracy highlights the model's potential to enhance proactive maintenance strategies and infrastructure sustainability in digital city environments. This work is the first to employ MTGNN for waterpipe failure prediction, offering a methodological advancement in short-term prediction and introducing a binary classification model that improves prediction precision across multiple time horizons.",10.1109/sustech63138.2025.11025674,2025,,IEEE
Exploring Bus Stop Mobility Pattern: A Multi-Pattern Deep Learning Prediction Framework,"The spatio-temporal prediction task in the transportation network is the core of the solutions for various traffic problems. On one hand, the mobility pattern in traffic can be reflected in the travel behavior of the crowd. In most traffic prediction tasks, the importance of the mobility pattern is often overlooked. On the other hand, traffic prediction also has a variety of predicting scenarios, including short-term and long-term prediction, and relevant research cannot solve the problems under the two scenarios at the same time. In view of the problem of existing work, we propose a multi-pattern traffic prediction framework, MPGNNFormer. First, we construct a new bus stop distance network to model the relationships between stops. Then, we use a graph neural network-based deep clustering method to extract the bus stop mobility pattern. Finally, we design a transformer-based spatio-temporal prediction model (STGNNFormer) to predict bus stop flow by taking full advantage of time dependency and space dependency. After that, we conduct a series of experiments to evaluate and test them on the real bus dataset, including analyzing mobility patterns and comparing prediction results.

Gegenbauer Graph Neural Networks for Time-Varying Signal Reconstruction,"Reconstructing time-varying graph signals (or graph time-series imputation) is a critical problem in machine learning and signal processing with broad applications, ranging from missing data imputation in sensor networks to time-series forecasting. Accurately capturing the spatio-temporal information inherent in these signals is crucial for effectively addressing these tasks. However, existing approaches relying on smoothness assumptions of temporal differences and simple convex optimization techniques that have inherent limitations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that incorporates a learning module to enhance the accuracy of the downstream task. To this end, we introduce the Gegenbauer-based graph convolutional (GegenConv) operator, which is a generalization of the conventional Chebyshev graph convolution by leveraging the theory of Gegenbauer polynomials. By deviating from traditional convex problems, we expand the complexity of the model and offer a more accurate solution for recovering time-varying graph signals. Building upon GegenConv, we design the Gegenbauer-based time graph neural network (GegenGNN) architecture, which adopts an encoder–decoder structure. Likewise, our approach also uses a dedicated loss function that incorporates a mean squared error (MSE) component alongside Sobolev smoothness regularization. This combination enables GegenGNN to capture both the fidelity to ground truth and the underlying smoothness properties of the signals, enhancing the reconstruction performance. We conduct extensive experiments on real datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The experimental results demonstrate that GegenGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its superior capability in recovering time-varying graph signals.",10.1109/tnnls.2024.3381069,2024,13,IEEE
Network Traffic Forecasting via Fuzzy Spatial-Temporal Fusion Graph Neural Networks,"Spatial-temporal network traffic prediction remains a formidable challenge due to the intricate spatial relationships and dynamic temporal patterns characteristic of individual nodes. Traditional regression methods fall short in handling such graph-structured data effectively. In recent developments, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in modeling these complex spatial-temporal interactions. Despite their potential, existing GNN-based approaches exhibit notable limitations: (1) they typically rely on fixed spatial adjacency matrices, which overlook fuzzy latent temporal dependencies; and (2) they often process spatial and temporal information independently, resulting in a loss of joint fuzzy dependencies or restricting the model to either global or local patterns alone. To overcome these issues, we introduce the Fuzzy Spatial-Temporal Fusion Graph Neural Network (FSTFGNN) based on Fuzzy Rough Sets. Our approach constructs a dynamic, data-driven fuzzy spatial-temporal fusion matrix to capture underlying low-level spatial-temporal joint relationships. Additionally, a fuzzy global-local unified GNN layer is incorporated to simultaneously learn global-local spatialtemporal dependencies. Experimental results on two real-world datasets validate the efficacy of the proposed FSTFGNN framework.",10.1109/iscmi63661.2024.10851677,2024,2,IEEE
Mobile Traffic Prediction in Consumer Applications: A Multimodal Deep Learning Approach,"Mobile traffic prediction is an important yet challenging problem in consumer applications because of the dynamic nature of user behavior, varying application quality of service (QoS) requirements, network congestion, and proliferation of diverse mobile devices. The mobile traffic prediction problem with multiple services, e.g., SMS, call, and Internet, is defined as the mapping from historical traffic data to future traffic prediction. Both grid and graph-based mobile traffic prediction formulations have been extensively considered in the literature. However, an effective multimodal deep learning approach with both grid and graph modals has not yet been fully considered. This study proposes a multimodal convolutional neural network (CNN)-graph neural network (GNN) hybrid framework for single-step mobile traffic prediction, in which the information extracted from SMS, call and Internet services are fused to make a precise prediction for future traffic consumption of consumers in the next hour. The CNN module is built using ConvLSTM, the GNN module is built using adaptive graph convolutional network (AGCN), and a fusion layer is designed to combine the outputs from the CNN and GNN modules.

Large Language Models for Wireless Cellular Traffic Prediction: A Multi-timespan Approach,"Wireless cellular traffic prediction is essential for efficient network management and monitoring, yet it is a challenging task due to the spatial and temporal characteristics of traffic. Recently, machine learning based traffic prediction algorithms have been proposed in the literature. However, these algorithms lack good generalization ability as they cannot adapt to frequent changes in traffic distribution typically encountered in wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a traffic prediction algorithm using large language models (LLMs). We first analyze the temporal characteristics of traffic and identify those timespans in the historical traffic information which are important for traffic prediction. We use a clustering algorithm to identify cells with similar traffic patterns. To predict the traffic in a cell, we incorporate the multi-timespan historical traffic information of the cell as well as those cells with similar traffic patterns into natural language sentences and provide them as input to the LLM. Using our proposed framework, we fine-tune three popular LLMs (BART, BigBird, and PEGASUS) on the traffic prediction task. Experimental results show that our proposed LLM framework outperforms a state-of-the-art graph neural network (GNN) baseline and achieves up to 12.32% improvement in terms of the mean absolute error (MAE). Moreover, the proposed LLM framework has excellent generalization ability under the zero-shot setting, reducing the MAE by up to 46.84% compared to the baseline. The ablation studies reveal that providing information from multiple timespans to the model reduces the MAE by up to 15.05% compared to only providing information from the most recent timespan.",10.1109/globecom52923.2024.10901784,2024,2,IEEE
