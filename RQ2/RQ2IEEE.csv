In this context, spatio-temporal graph neural networks have attracted significant interest due to their outstanding performance. An established approach involves integrating graph convolutional networks into recurrent neural networks. However, this approach faces difficulties in capturing dynamic spatial correlations and discerning the correlation of multi-channel time series signals. Another major problem is that the discrete time interval of recurrent neural networks limits the accuracy of spatio-temporal prediction. To address these challenges, we propose a continuous spatio-temporal framework, termed Recurrent Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network based on Latent Time Graph (RST-LTG). RST-LTG incorporates adaptive graph convolution networks with a time embedding generator to construct a latent time graph, which subtly captures evolving spatial characteristics by aggregating spatial information across multiple time steps. Additionally, to improve the accuracy of continuous time modeling, we introduce a gate enhanced neural ordinary differential equation that effectively integrates information across multiple scales. Empirical results on four publicly available datasets demonstrate that the RST-LTG model outperforms 19 competing methods in terms of accuracy.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2024.3479917","Basic Research Program Project of the Shenyang Institute of Automation; Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:2022000346); Liaoning Province Applied Basic Research Program(grant numbers:2022JH2/101300255); Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:E329100101); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10715638","Multi-channel time series signal;spatio-temporal graph neural network;neural ordinary differential equation;latent time graph","Time series analysis;Convolution;Predictive models;Forecasting;Correlation;Decoding;Mathematical models;Feature extraction;Attention mechanisms;Adaptation models","","7","","33","IEEE","14 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is a challenging task, as we need to consider both complex intra-variable dependencies and inter-variable dependencies. Existing works only learn temporal patterns with the help of single inter-variable dependencies. However, there are multi-scale temporal patterns in many real-world MTS. Single inter-variable dependencies make the model prefer to learn one type of prominent and shared temporal patterns. In this article, we propose a multi-scale adaptive graph neural network (MAGNN) to address the above issue. MAGNN exploits a multi-scale pyramid network to preserve the underlying temporal dependencies at different time scales. Since the inter-variable dependencies may be different under distinct time scales, an adaptive graph learning module is designed to infer the scale-specific inter-variable dependencies without pre-defined priors. Given the multi-scale feature representations and scale-specific inter-variable dependencies, a multi-scale temporal graph neural network is introduced to jointly model intra-variable dependencies and inter-variable dependencies. After that, we develop a scale-wise fusion module to effectively promote the collaboration across different time scales, and automatically capture the importance of contributed temporal patterns.

In particular, we consider spatio-temporal graphs where each node is associated with the aggregate load of a cluster of smart meters, and a global graph-level attribute indicates the total load on the grid. We propose two novel spatio-temporal graph neural network models to process this representation and take advantage of both the finer-grained information and the relationships existing between the different clusters of meters. We compare these models on a widely used, openly available, benchmark against a competitive baseline which only accounts for the total load profile. Within these settings, we show that the proposed methodology improves forecasting accuracy.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-8671-9","10.1109/IJCNN55064.2022.9892780","Swiss Federal Office of Energy(grant numbers:SI/501888-01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9892780","Spatio- Temporal Graph Neural Network;Smart Grid;Electric Load Forecasting","Load forecasting;Aggregates;Time series analysis;Redundancy;Smart meters;Graph neural networks;Power grids","","4","","36","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By leveraging accurate and comprehensive spatio-temporal sequence prediction models, it becomes possible to extract higher-order spatio-temporal interactions between real-world connections, thereby contributing to smart city construction. Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have emerged as a highly effective approach for addressing spatio-temporal series prediction challenges. Nevertheless, most existing methods predominantly rely on traditional graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and their variants for spatial feature extraction. Due to inherent limitations such as over-smoothing, these models often constrain spatial feature encoding to shallow architectures, typically limited to 2-3 layers. Additionally, the presence of noisy data in real-world scenarios significantly impacts the prediction accuracy of existing STGNN models. In this paper, building upon the classic STGNN framework, we propose a graph neural network framework based on deep residual connections and noise injection mechanism to address the aforementioned issues. Specifically, inspired by the principles of initial residual connection and identity mapping, we proposed a deep spatio-temporal graph neural network framework of 12 layers to capture the high-dimensional interactions, while using noise injection mechanism to mitigate the adverse effects of noisy data.

In this work, we propose a novel framework for cellular KPI prediction, which considers its distribution discrepancy under different network operation scenarios. In particular, three specific predictors for normal, target alarm, and neighbor alarm scenarios are proposed based on spatiotemporal graph neural networks and unified through transfer learning. Temporal convolution and attention mechanism are embedded to model the impact of anomalies on KPIs and its propagation across neighboring cells according to the cellular network topology. An experiment on a real cellular KPI dataset shows the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-arts. Note to Practitioners—Cellular network KPI prediction under scenarios of network alarms is crucial to evaluate the impact of alarms on network services and guides cellular network maintenance policies. This problem is similar to a general multivariate time series prediction problem with data multimodality. However, the first challenge in our case is that, under different scenarios, i.e., normal, target alarm, and neighbor alarm, the effective information and spatiotemporal dependencies among KPIs are different. The second challenge is the imbalanced or sparse sample size for specific scenarios, deteriorating the model performance. This paper proposes a cellular KPI prediction framework consisting of three scenario-specific predictors with similar but different modules to process different scenario-specific data. To address the dataset imbalance across scenarios, we adopt a transfer learning strategy to unify the training and prediction of three predictors. The experiment results on a real cellular KPI dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework is more feasible and effective than the state-of-the-art models for multivariate time series prediction. Future research can consider developing maintenance policies such that the cost caused by abnormal KPIs can be minimized.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2024.3416952","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:71932006,72271138); Beijing Natural Science Foundation (BNSF)(grant numbers:9222014); Research Fund from Huawei; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10571823","Cellular network;multivariate time series prediction;graph neural network;multi-scenario;transfer learning","Time series analysis;Graph neural networks;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Predictive models;Key performance indicator;Correlation;Cellular networks","","3","","42","IEEE","25 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The service invocation trace and the pod performance metrics are recorded and analyzed to detect anomalies and ensure system stability. Spatiotemporal graph neural network models are popular for time-series representation as they can capture intra- and inter-correlation of time series. However, we find that the performance of anomaly detection depends on the dynamic correlation between containers in microservice system greatly, but has not been considered in existing work. To capture the correlation both on pod level and metric level, we propose a hierachcical graph neural network model, HiGraph, cascading of MetricLayer and PodLayer modules. MetricLayer is used to compute the correlation between metrics through mutual information. PodLayer is used to learn the dynamical correlation of the pods from trace data. It is important to note that trace data continuously records calls, while metric data has a sampling interval, making temporal alignment difficult. To address this, we innovatively use the edge weights of the graph to align them. We count the call frequency between different pods in the trace data over a specific period to update the weights of the spatial correlation graph. Extensive experiments on real data demonstrate that HiGraph improves RMSE by 4.9%, MAE by 4.8%, F1-score by 4.2% and recall by 9.2% compared to the best baseline.","","979-8-3315-1262-0","10.1109/WCCCT65447.2025.11028023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11028023","Microservice;anomaly detection;time series;graph neural network","Measurement;Correlation;Time series analysis;Microservice architectures;Containers;Graph neural networks;Stability analysis;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Anomaly detection;Mutual information","","","","21","IEEE","13 Jun 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have shown promising performances in modeling spatial dependencies based on graph neural networks (GNNs) and temporal dependencies based on temporal learning modules. However, most STGNNs do not effectively integrate explicit and implicit relationships between nodes, nor do they adequately capture long and short-term time dependencies. To address these challenges, this paper presents a Quaternion Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Network (QSTGNN). Specifically, the quaternion spatio-temporal graph is constructed firstly, such that the information of both short and long-term time steps are preserved in quaternion feature tensor, and information of multiple explicit graphs and implicit graph are integrated in quaternion graph adjacency matrix. Then, two modules are designed: a 1D quaternion convolution module and a quaternion graph convolution module. In the 1D quaternion convolution module, complex temporal correlations among short and long-term time steps can be well exploited by 1D quaternion convolution operator based on the quaternion Hamilton product. In the quaternion graph convolution module, quaternion graph convolution is designed to characterize nonlinear dependencies among multiple spatial graphs, including explicit and implicit graphs. Extensive experiments are conducted on six datasets, and the results show that QSTGNN achieves state-of-the-art performances over the existing ten methods. Explainable analysis presents that multiple spatial correlations can accurately illustrate the traffic flow and road functional information in real traffic roads.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2025.3571983","National Science and Technology Major Project(grant numbers:2022ZD0117700); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U21A20520,62325204,62306118); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11007492","1D quaternion convolution neural network;Quaternion;Spatio-temporal network;Spatio-temporal data forecasting;Quaternion graph neural network","Quaternions;Convolution;Time series analysis;Graph neural networks;Forecasting;Correlation;Data mining;Transformers;Predictive models;Feature extraction","","","","44","IEEE","20 May 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Deep learning models have achieved considerable success in addressing MTSC problems. However, a key challenge faced by existing classification models is how to effectively consider the correlations between time series instances and across channels simultaneously, as well as how to capture the dynamic of these inter-channel correlations over time. Current methods often fall short in these aspects: on one hand, they fail to fully account for the combined effects of inter-instance and inter-channel correlations; on the other hand, they largely overlook the dynamic nature of how inter-channel correlations change over time. To address these issues, we propose a novel graph neural network model, called Similarity-Aware Graph of Graphs neural networks (SAGoG), for multivariate time series classification. This model can comprehensively consider the dependencies between channel-level and instance-level time series, it dynamically learns dependency features through graph structure evolution and graph pooling layers.

Our results show that linear spectral-temporal GNNs are universal under mild assumptions, and their expressive power is bounded by our extended first-order Weisfeiler–Leman algorithm on discrete-time dynamic graphs.

Recent work primarily employs the Transformer and its variant to capture broad temporal dependencies from time series. However, most approaches often overly focus on the impact of temporal relation, while neglecting the interactions among multivariate elements, and lacking the application of causal relationships. Int the paper, we introduce a Transformer variant based on causal discovery to discover and utilize causal relationships, termed the Causalformer. Our Causalformer not only captures temporal features but also learns a Granger causality graph from multivariate time series, resulting in a sparse adjacency matrix that represents the causal relationships between variables. This allows us to leverage causal relationships to estimate the degree of influence among multivariate elements, thereby further enhancing forecast accuracy. Building upon this, we configure the decoder part as multi-headed output to utilize the causal matrix for understanding how each variable is influenced by others. To accelerate the model’s learning speed, we also design the decoder as generative, allowing it to output an extended time series sequence in a single shot rather than step-by-step, significantly improving inference efficiency. We conduct experiments on three datasets. In most cases, the forecast results were significantly better than other baselines, and the accuracy of causal discovery was not significantly different from that of SOTA.","","979-8-3503-3075-5","10.1109/CISP-BMEI60920.2023.10373365","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10373365","","Time series analysis;Buildings;Predictive models;Signal processing;Transformers;Decoding;Sparse matrices","","3","","32","IEEE","2 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most existing spatio-temporal GNN frameworks are based on a two-step modeling process. In such scenario, spatial and temporal dependencies are modeled in separate steps, which lead to problems such as complex architecture design, hard to scale, etc. Targeting the shortcomings of existing studies, we take both spatial and temporal dependencies from another perspective, and consider them as two heterogeneous types of edges in the graph. We propose a unified spatio-temporal GNN framework that captures both dependencies in a single step. More specifically, for each node in the graph, a unified neural network component is designed to simultaneously extract information from its sur-rounding neighbors (spatial) and its past records (temporal), which enables much easier dependency aggregation with faster execution.

In addition, in many processes, the quality of the final product cannot be detected online, making it challenging to achieve timely and effective control. Therefore, in many processes, middle-state variables are observed and used for control. In many cases, these middle-state variables cannot be measured online. Long sequence multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) reveals the changes in the process in advance and allows us to make timely adjustments in predictive control mode. However, many current MTSF methods do not consider the relationships between variables adequately, making it difficult to achieve satisfactory results for long sequence forecasting. To address this problem, a novel sparse attention spectral graph neural network (SASGNN) is proposed. In SASGNN, a graph structure learning module is first developed to establish relationships between different variables by combining prior knowledge with a sparse attention mechanism. Then, a long sequence forecasting module transforms the constructed graph into the spectral domain to extract the latent temporal pattern of each variable and the correlation feature between different variables. Besides, considering the temporal information loss during modeling, SASGNN uses a variant GRU to extract the long-term dependencies from the historical data.

Recent advances in temporal graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promising results in multivariate time series forecasting due to their ability to characterize high-dimensional nonlinear correlations and temporal patterns. However, the vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) constitutes serious concerns about using these models to make decisions in real-world applications. Currently, how to defend multivariate forecasting models, especially temporal GNNs, is overlooked. The existing adversarial defense studies are mostly in static and single-instance classification domains, which cannot apply to forecasting due to the generalization challenge and the contradiction issue. To bridge this gap, we propose an adversarial danger identification method for temporally dynamic graphs to effectively protect GNN-based forecasting models. Our method consists of three steps: 1) a hybrid GNN-based classifier to identify dangerous times; 2) approximate linear error propagation to identify the dangerous variates based on the high-dimensional linearity of DNNs; and 3) a scatter filter controlled by the two identification processes to reform time series with reduced feature erasure. Our experiments, including four adversarial attack methods and four state-of-the-art forecasting models, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in defending forecasting models against adversarial attacks.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2023.3252175","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada; NSFC-FRQSC Research Program on Smart Cities and Big Data; Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10068359","Adversarial attack;filter-based defense;graph neural network (GNN);multivariate time series forecasting","Forecasting;Predictive models;Time series analysis;Perturbation methods;Graph neural networks;Correlation;Training","","6","","65","IEEE","13 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This inherent limitation restricts the comprehensive extraction of valuable information. To address this challenge, we propose the Multi-Granularity Deep Spatio-Temporal Correlation Framework (MDSTCF). Our approach combines the strengths of a multi-granularity residual learning, gated recurrent units, and graph attention networks to extract spatio-temporal information specific to each granularity. Subsequently, predictions at each granularity are generated through the prediction layer. Finally, a soft attention mechanism is employed to assign weights to the predictions at each granularity to obtain the final result. Comprehensive experiments conducted on tow stock datasets show that the proposed forecasting model improves the F1 score by about 7.88% and 11.2%, and the cumulative relative returns are close to 80% and 40%, respectively, compared to the previously studied time series forecasting models.

However, because the variances in flows among stations are large, bicycle dispatch is difficult without a precise flow forecasting approach. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach to forecast bicycle flow on the basis of a graph neural network (GNN). Instead of processing the temporal information using RNN, or 1D-CNN, our approach integrates both spatial and temporal information into graphs, and analyzes them using graph convolution.

Spatio-temporal graph neural network models for multi-channel time series forecasting have recently gained traction, owing to their ability in capturing both spatial and temporal features. A common practice is the integration of graph convolutional networks with recurrent neural networks. However, the discrete intervals of recurrent neural networks pose limitations on the temporal resolution of time series forecasting, impeding the model's ability to capture subtle changes in the data. To address this challenge, we introduce a continuous spatio-temporal framework, termed Graph Ordinary Differential Equation Recurrent Network (GODERN).

Furthermore, given the actual time representation in GODERN, we propose a novel augmented method of neural ordinary differential equation with fast-slow dynamics, thus allowing the encapsulation of multi-scale information.

Deep learning models have been extensively explored and adopted in regression and classification tasks. However, deep learning has limitations, such as the assumption of equally spaced and ordered data, and the inability to incorporate graph structure in time-series prediction. Graph Neural Network (GNN) can overcome these challenges by capturing the temporal dependencies in time-series data effectively. In this study, we propose a novel approach for predicting time-series data using GNN, augmented with Reinforcement Learning(GraphRL) for monitoring.

The proposed approach addresses two significant challenges: ensuring valid marginal coverage despite dependencies between calibration (training) and test data, and reducing prediction interval inefficiency while maintaining coverage guarantees. The framework incorporates a topology-aware correction model and employs graph-based regularization terms to enhance prediction accuracy. The methodology is validated using field monitoring data from the Wutong Village landslide in Sichuan Province, China, where six GNSS monitoring points track surface deformation patterns.

However, spatio-temporal data include complex non-linear relational and spatial dependencies. In addition, dynamic contextual information also impacts resources. Methods that consider context assume that the impact of context on resources is fixed, which is not realistic. For example, in a bicycle-sharing system, bike supply in stations is affected by the weather, and that effect changes over time. We propose a novel graph-based context integrated relational model, Context Integrated Graph Neural Network (CIGNN), which models temporal, relational, spatial, and dynamic contextual dependencies for multi-step ahead resource forecasting. We define a resource graph, where nodes represent locations with associated resource time-series, and context graphs (one for each type of context), where nodes represent locations with associated contextual time-series. Assuming that various contexts have dynamic impact on resources, our proposed CIGNN model employs a novel fusion mechanism that jointly learns from multiple contextual time-series. To the best of our knowledge, CIGNN is the first approach that integrates dynamic contextual information using graph neural networks for resource forecasting. Empirical results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that CIGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.","","978-1-6654-3902-2","10.1109/BigData52589.2021.9671705","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9671705","Demand and supply forecasting;Graph Neural Network;Spatio-temporal time-series analysis","Social networking (online);Time series analysis;Predictive models;Big Data;Dynamic scheduling;Graph neural networks;Data models","","1","","52","IEEE","13 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) excel at modeling interrelationships in STF tasks but face difficulties with long sequence inputs due to inefficient training. In contrast, LTSF models handle long sequences well but struggle with capturing complex variable interrelationships. This paper proposes the Spectral Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (S2GNN) to address these challenges, proposing a framework capable of handling long-term spatiotemporal forecasting. S2GNN leverages a decoupled GNN along with an MLP architecture to ensure efficiency. Specifically, it employs spectral GNNs for global feature extraction on an adaptive graph structure; the visualization of the filters resembles a band-rejection shape, indicating the presence of both homophilic and heterophilic relationships between nodes. Additionally, we introduce scale-adaptive node embeddings and cross-correlation embeddings for better differentiation between similar temporal patterns.

It provides benefits from app development to targeted investment. Popularity is affected by two factors, i.e., internal ones like reviews and external ones like interaction among apps. However, most related studies only explore internal factors but neglect external ones. In fact, external factor plays an important role in popularity prediction modelling since it is the promoting and/or inhibiting influence resulted by app interaction. The app interaction has two major characteristics, i.e., interactivity and dynamicity, which brings challenges to app popularity prediction due to two reasons: 1) interactivity—it is hard to evaluate the existence and influence intensity of interactions; 2) dynamicity—the nature of interaction influence, e.g., promoting or inhibiting, and its intensity on popularity change with time. In this paper, we propose DeePOP, a popularity prediction model that innovatively leverages time-varying hierarchical interactions. First, we propose Hierarchical Interaction Graph, which is first studied in this work, to organically characterize the relationship and influence among apps. Second, DeePOP integrates internal factors and time-varying hierarchical interactions as inputs to build the prediction model.

The prevailing approaches primarily leverage graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) to extract spatial features. However, some studies suggest that the poor performance on uneven graphs is primarily due to the fact that traditional graph neural networks (GNNs) are essentially low-pass filters, discarding information beyond low-frequency information on the graph. From another perspective, since the essence of graph convolution is the smoothing of node features, for uneven graphs, there are noticeable differences in the smoothing rates of node features, leading to the coexistence of overfitting and underfitting phenomena. This issue is further exacerbated in higher order graph structures, such as hypergraphs, due to the irregular and complex nature of hyperedges. To address this issue, we propose a filtered hypergraph neural network. Building on the calculation of hypergraph node smoothing rates, we balance the low-pass and high-pass filter convolutions’ feature extraction through a dual-stream architecture. On uneven graphs, it can be observed that neglecting high-frequency information and concentrating solely on low-frequency information impede the learning of node representations, thereby significantly affecting the performance of downstream prediction tasks.

However, due to its inherently temporal volatility and intermittency, accurate wind speed forecasting in a wind farm is challenging. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable performance in abundant natural language processing and computer vision tasks. However, the conventional LLMs fail to learn the complex spatial and temporal correlations of the wind speed data at multiple turbines in a wind farm, which makes wind speed forecasting cannot fully benefit from the significant breakthroughs of LLM. To fill in this gap, we propose a novel spatial–temporal cross-attention LLM framework for wind speed forecasting, namely, spatial–temporal cross-attention LLM (STCA-LLM), composed of alignment phase, and fine-tuning phase. In detail, our contributions are given as follows. First, the alignment phase aligns the general-purpose LLM with task-specific data, i.e., training the LLM with wind speed data. Second, in the fine-tuning phase, two representation learning modules, i.e., convolution network and graph neural network (GNN) are, respectively used to extract temporal features of intra time series in each turbine, and the correlation of inter time-series at multiple turbines in a wind farm. Moreover, the cross-attention module is innovatively proposed to establish the connections between spatial and temporal embeddings. Then, the spatial–temporal representation modules and the aligned LLM are fine-tuned in two-stage way. Finally, thorough experiments on real wind speed dataset demonstrate that our proposed STCA-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art time series forecasting models, including Transformer-based models, spatial–temporal GNN-based models, and pertained LLM-based models.

At present, many transformer-based methods have made promising progress. However, the nature of the permutation-invariant self-attention mechanism inevitably results in temporal information loss, which hinders the prediction performance of the transformer-based LTSF methods. Therefore, this article proposed a novel temporal chain network (TCNet) with an intuitive attention mechanism for LTSF. Based on the chain forward propagation structure of time series, a one-way chain graph neural network (GNN) is constructed to avoid the permutation-invariance of the self-attention mechanism. Meanwhile, based on the natural forgetting mechanism of time series, the prior intuitive attention is proposed as the edge weight (attention) for information propagation and then the series model is obtained by the GNN. Furthermore, the proposed method achieves the LTSF task by linear forecasting of the trend component and nonlinear forecasting of the seasonal component of the series. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks and a real-world chemical process dataset are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the TCNet. Comparison experiment results show that the TCNet achieves state-of-the-art results compared to current baselines and reduces average prediction error by 9.52% and 5.97% on transformer-based and nontransformer-based multivariate LTSF baselines, respectively. Moreover, the temporal information loss for the TCNet due to the permutation-invariance of the self-attention mechanism is not the main reason hindering transformer-based LTSF methods, whose bottleneck comes mainly from the complex architecture of the decoder.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2023.3322508","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:21978013); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central in China(grant numbers:XK1802-4); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10273738","Attention mechanism;neural networks;permutation-invariance;time series forecasting;transformer","Transformers;Time series analysis;Forecasting;Task analysis;Predictive models;Decoding;Convolution","","13","","38","IEEE","6 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address this issue, an unsupervised sensor self-diagnosis method is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the Pearson correlation coefficient is introduced to construct a graph network of sensors of the same type, and node embedding is used to form super nodes of sensors. Secondly, transfer entropy is utilized to assess the causal relationships between these super nodes, based on which a super node graph network is constructed. Finally, a Multi-Head Self-Attention Gated Graph Convolutional Network (MCB-GCN) is introduced. This network captures spatial and temporal dependencies of nodes and, with the help of an enhanced fusion module, achieves time-series prediction for sensors. Subsequently, sensor self-diagnosis is achieved through a standardized residual consistency check algorithm.

Furthermore, there is room for improvement when applying previous multivariate time series prediction methods on flight track forecasting, since both local and global attribute features and interattribute relationships have an important impact on the flight track features. In this article, we propose a global and local interattribute relationships-based graph convolutional network (GLAR-GCN) to solve the flight trajectory prediction problem. First, we fuse the local embedded attribute feature and global attribute pattern to obtain the accumulated local embedded features at each point. Meanwhile, we synthesize the local and global attribute correlations to obtain the augmented attribute correlations at each point. Second, we construct an attribute graph at each point, where the nodes are the accumulated local embedded features and the edges are the augmented attribute correlations. Third, we extract the integrated attribute features from each attribute graph with a graph convolutional network. Finally, we perform trajectory prediction with the integrated attribute features as the input of a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. We evaluate the proposed model GLAR-GCN on real short-haul, medium-haul, and long-haul flight datasets for single-step and multistep prediction.

When predicting pollutant concentrations, it is common to include the effects of environmental factors that influence these concentrations within an extended period, like traffic, meteorological conditions and geographical information. Most of the existing approaches exploit this information as past covariates, i.e., past exogenous variables that affected the pollutant but were not affected by it. In this paper, we present a novel forecasting methodology to predict NO2 concentration via both past and future covariates. Future covariates are represented by weather forecasts and future calendar events, which are already known at prediction time. In particular, we deal with air quality observations in a city-wide network of ground monitoring stations, modeling the data structure and estimating the predictions with a Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (STGNN). We propose a conditioning block that embeds past and future covariates into the current observations. After extracting meaningful spatiotemporal representations, these are fused together and projected into the forecasting horizon to generate the final prediction. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that future covariates are included in time series predictions in a structured way. Remarkably, we find that conditioning on future weather information has a greater impact than considering past traffic conditions.

On the other hand, traffic prediction also has a variety of predicting scenarios, including short-term and long-term prediction, and relevant research cannot solve the problems under the two scenarios at the same time. In view of the problem of existing work, we propose a multi-pattern traffic prediction framework, MPGNNFormer.

Then, we use a graph neural network-based deep clustering method to extract the bus stop mobility pattern. Finally, we design a transformer-based spatio-temporal prediction model (STGNNFormer) to predict bus stop flow by taking full advantage of time dependency and space dependency. After that, we conduct a series of experiments to evaluate and test them on the real bus dataset, including analyzing mobility patterns and comparing prediction results.

However, existing approaches relying on smoothness assumptions of temporal differences and simple convex optimization techniques that have inherent limitations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that incorporates a learning module to enhance the accuracy of the downstream task. To this end, we introduce the Gegenbauer-based graph convolutional (GegenConv) operator, which is a generalization of the conventional Chebyshev graph convolution by leveraging the theory of Gegenbauer polynomials. By deviating from traditional convex problems, we expand the complexity of the model and offer a more accurate solution for recovering time-varying graph signals. Building upon GegenConv, we design the Gegenbauer-based time graph neural network (GegenGNN) architecture, which adopts an encoder–decoder structure. Likewise, our approach also uses a dedicated loss function that incorporates a mean squared error (MSE) component alongside Sobolev smoothness regularization. This combination enables GegenGNN to capture both the fidelity to ground truth and the underlying smoothness properties of the signals, enhancing the reconstruction performance. We conduct extensive experiments on real datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

Traditional regression methods fall short in handling such graph-structured data effectively. In recent developments, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in modeling these complex spatial-temporal interactions. Despite their potential, existing GNN-based approaches exhibit notable limitations: (1) they typically rely on fixed spatial adjacency matrices, which overlook fuzzy latent temporal dependencies; and (2) they often process spatial and temporal information independently, resulting in a loss of joint fuzzy dependencies or restricting the model to either global or local patterns alone. To overcome these issues, we introduce the Fuzzy Spatial-Temporal Fusion Graph Neural Network (FSTFGNN) based on Fuzzy Rough Sets. Our approach constructs a dynamic, data-driven fuzzy spatial-temporal fusion matrix to capture underlying low-level spatial-temporal joint relationships. Additionally, a fuzzy global-local unified GNN layer is incorporated to simultaneously learn global-local spatialtemporal dependencies.

Recently, machine learning based traffic prediction algorithms have been proposed in the literature. However, these algorithms lack good generalization ability as they cannot adapt to frequent changes in traffic distribution typically encountered in wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a traffic prediction algorithm using large language models (LLMs). We first analyze the temporal characteristics of traffic and identify those timespans in the historical traffic information which are important for traffic prediction. We use a clustering algorithm to identify cells with similar traffic patterns. To predict the traffic in a cell, we incorporate the multi-timespan historical traffic information of the cell as well as those cells with similar traffic patterns into natural language sentences and provide them as input to the LLM. Using our proposed framework, we fine-tune three popular LLMs (BART, BigBird, and PEGASUS) on the traffic prediction task. Experimental results show that our proposed LLM framework outperforms a state-of-the-art graph neural network (GNN) baseline and achieves up to 12.32% improvement in terms of the mean absolute error (MAE). Moreover, the proposed LLM framework has excellent generalization ability under the zero-shot setting, reducing the MAE by up to 46.84% compared to the baseline. The ablation studies reveal that providing information from multiple timespans to the model reduces the MAE by up to 15.05% compared to only providing information from the most recent timespan.","2576-6813","979-8-3503-5125-5","10.1109/GLOBECOM52923.2024.10901784","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10901784","","Machine learning algorithms;Large language models;Wireless networks;Natural languages;Clustering algorithms;Traffic control;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Graph neural networks;Monitoring","","2","","13","IEEE","11 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the existing methods for regional load forecasting often lack consideration of the differentiated load characteristics and the interrelationships between various types of loads. Particularly during extreme weather events, demand responses, and other special occurrences, focusing only on the overall trend of regional load changes can lead to significant forecasting errors. Additionally, under extreme weather conditions, various loads within a region exhibit different response patterns. This paper proposes a multivariate time series forecasting model based on an Adaptive Graph Neural Network (ADAGNN) to treat various load types as nodes in a graph network, adaptively constructing adjacency matrices through a graph construction layer to extract inter-load relational information; it also uses graph convolution and temporal convolution to capture different load change patterns in regional loads. Considering the existence of different scales of cyclical changes in time series, an initial dilated convolution method is proposed, endowing the ADAGNN model with the ability to adaptively select the size of convolution kernels to extract multi-scale features of the original series. Ultimately, the model outputs the forecast data for all categorized loads, and the regional load forecast is obtained by summation. A case study is conducted using regional load data from a province in China. Relative to the optimal model in the control group, the proposed ADAGNN model improved by 1.06%, 43.32%, and 42.24% in the MAPE, MAE, and RMSE metrics, respectively, thus validating its high predictive accuracy and scalability.","2158-4907","979-8-3503-4530-8","10.1109/ICPS60943.2024.10563907","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10563907","Inception layer;Adaptive Graph neural network;Regional load;Short term forecasting;Load forecasting","Industries;Adaptation models;Adaptive systems;Accuracy;Load forecasting;Convolution;Predictive models","","","","25","IEEE","24 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
